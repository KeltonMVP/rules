Businesses are locations specific to daily life, such as FastFoods or clothing stores. On the B-Zone RPG server, these are buildings that any player can buy if they have a certain amount of money required and a certain level set for that business.

Businesses also have a certain money production like houses, so every time a player enters a business, they will be charged an amount of money called entrance fee. Any business owner can set the entrance fee for their business, except for businesses that have a standard fee.

- Any player who has at least level 9 can purchase a business.
- Each business has an informational text placed next to the entrance door. Looking at the informational text you will find out the following aspects about that business:

    - The business ID, located on the first line of the paragraph.
    - The informational name of the business.
    - The names of the business owners (you can see the owners using /shareholders).
    - The level you need to be able to buy the respective business.
    - The entrance fee.

## The Shares System

The shares system is a system based on buying and selling shares in a certain business. You can own a minimum of 10% of the profit from a business and a maximum of 100%, you can also own shares in multiple businesses at once. For example, you can own 10% of CNN LS, 20% of Pizza Idlewood, 40% of Clothes Store LS, until you reach the maximum of 100% that you can own. Depending on the percentage you own of a certain business, you will also receive your share of the profit, a simple example is if you own 10% of CNN LS and it produces $1,000,000 daily, you will earn $100,000 that day owning 10% of the business.

You can sell the shares of a business to another player using the [/trade] command, to sell the shares to the state for $0 you can use the [/sellshares] command.
