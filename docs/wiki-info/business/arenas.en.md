The B-Zone RPG server has multiple arenas: Paintball Arena, Racing Arena, War Arena, Gun Game Arena, Last Car Standing Arena and PUBG Arena. Within these businesses, players can enter competitions with other players or participate in events. To be able to enter, you must pay a fee set by the owner (between $1 and $100), but this fee will be collected at the start of the round, so you will not have to pay anything if you are alone in the business.

## Paintball Arena

- It is located in the Market area, Los Santos and is marked on the map with a specific icon.
- It represents a safezone.
- You need a weapons license to participate.
- After the first player of the round enters the arena, a waiting period of 30 seconds begins. During this period, other players can join the round, and you will not be able to move.
- At the end of the waiting period, a vote will be held to determine the weapons used. You can vote for a match with a single weapon or a match with a pair of weapons. The voting lasts a few seconds, and each player has the right to choose only one option.
- In Paintball Arena, 6 types of weapons are available: Deagle, MP5, M4, AK47, Tec-9 and Combat Shotgun.
- As soon as the voting ends, a weapon or pair of weapons is chosen as the winner, and a 4-minute match begins.
- Now, at the bottom of the screen you will be able to see a scoreboard. Here appears the name of the player in the lead, their number of kills, as well as your personal score.
- This personal score consists of: kills, deaths, streak and longest streak. Streak represents the number of players killed without dying, and longest streak is the maximum number of players killed without dying throughout the entire match.
- At the end of the 4 minutes, the winner will be announced, the player with the highest streak and your personal score.
- Throughout an active match you can continue to enter the arena and you will start with zero score.
- The sum won by the best player will be $110.
- To leave the arena use the /leavepaintball command.

- Another 30 seconds are available for voting on a map on which the race will take place.
- Then, players must vote on the type of cars they will compete with.
- After that, each player can choose their car and customize its colors. On the right side, there is a table with information about the vehicle, such as the model name, speed and acceleration.
- Also, competitors can bet on themselves. To do this, they must press the "+" button under the information table. You can bet on amounts between $500 and $5,000, with a step of $500. For the bet to be valid, at least two players must bet the same amount. At the end of the race, the first bettor who crosses the finish line (does not have to be in 1st position) will win all the money put into play.
