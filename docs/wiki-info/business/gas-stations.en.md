A gas station on the B-Zone RPG server means a location where you can increase the fuel reserves of a vehicle.

Players are able to drive only vehicles that have fuel in the tank.

The RPG server has 19 gas stations, placed in each of the three main cities, as well as in other secondary locations.

## Characteristics

- A player who does not have a premium account can fill a vehicle's tank up to 100%.
- A player who has a premium account can fill a vehicle's tank up to 150%.
- This type of business does not have an interior.
- Each gas station is marked on the radar with an icon similar to a transport truck.

## Specific Commands

### /fill

With the help of this command, any player can fuel their vehicle up to 100% fuel, in the case of players without a premium account, and up to 150% fuel, in the case of players who have a premium account.

The command is executed successfully only if you are in a vehicle and close enough to the fueling station.

The command also allows specifying the "percent" parameter, its syntax being: /fill [percent].

*Example: /fill 10 will add 10 percent of fuel to the tank of the vehicle you are in.*

### /fillgascan

The command is used to fill the fuel canister. The canister will be filled only if the one using the command owns one.

Any player on the server can buy a fuel canister from a 24/7 store.

The command is executed successfully only if you are close enough to the fueling station, in a vehicle or on foot.

Once the command is executed correctly and successfully, the canister will be filled and will have a volume depending on the skill level at the Mechanic job.
