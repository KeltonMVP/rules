## Characteristics

- The B-Zone RPG server has one such store in each of the three cities: Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro.
- Each gun shop is marked on the map with a pistol icon as in image #1.
- The money that the server deducts when entering the gun shop premises represents only the entrance fee. To buy a weapon you pay separately.
- Each gun shop has an interior area (grill) where you can eat, increasing your health level (HP) up to 100%.
- To eat, use the /eat command and it will cost $60.
- To buy a weapon, use the /buygun command.
- The /buygun command also displays both weapon prices and the price for a bullet.

*Note: Knife, Sniper Rifle, Tec9, Uzi, Sawn-off Shotgun and Combat Shotgun are special weapons that cannot be purchased from Gun Shop. They are only available in certain factions.*

*Note: The health amounts (HP) displayed above represent the damage caused by a single bullet from the respective weapon.*

*Note: Combat Shotgun and Shotgun are weapons that fire bursts of bullets, which may or may not hit the target. The damage caused by these weapons decreases as the distance between the target and the shooter increases, due to the bullets spreading over a larger area.*

## Specific Commands

### /buygun

By typing this command without specifying any parameter, the server will display a list of weapons available in the store, as well as their prices. To buy a weapon, the command is completed using the parameters: weapon name, ammunition quantity (bullets).

*Example: /buygun Deagle 999 - The command will buy the Deagle weapon with 999 bullets.*

*Note: The maximum ammunition that a player can purchase by typing the command once is 999.*

### /eat

To increase your health reserves (HP), gun shops provide specially created places for "eating", using the /eat command. For the command to be executed successfully, you must be as close as possible to the grill inside the shops. By typing the command, the server will deduct $60 from your money and give you +20 HP.

*Note: As an alternative to this command, you can use the LALT key.*
