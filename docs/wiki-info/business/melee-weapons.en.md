The B-Zone RPG server has one such store in each of the three cities: Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro.

The player needs a valid weapons license to be able to purchase a melee weapon.

## Characteristics

- Each melee weapons store is marked on the map with a pistol icon as in image #1.
- The money that the server deducts when entering the weapons store premises represents only the entrance fee. To buy a weapon you pay separately.
- You cannot hold more than one melee weapon simultaneously due to game mechanics. (Each type of weapon has its own slot, so a new melee weapon would overwrite the old weapon)
- This type of business has an interior.

## Available Weapons

To buy a weapon you must go to the icon inside the store and press the Y key.

After pressing the Y key, a menu will open from which you can choose what melee weapon you want to buy.

Available weapons are:

1. Katana - $1,000
2. Golf Club - $250
3. Baseball - $250
4. Shovel - $500
5. Pool Cue - $250
6. Brass knuckles - $500

After you have chosen the desired weapon, press the BUY button to purchase it. If you no longer want to buy a melee weapon, you can exit the menu by pressing the CANCEL button.

## Damage Caused by Weapons

Each melee weapon causes different damage:

1. Katana - 2.6 HP
2. Golf Club - 4.6 HP
3. Baseball - 4.6 HP
4. Shovel - 4.6 HP
5. Pool Cue - 4.6 HP
6. Brass knuckles - 1.3 HP
