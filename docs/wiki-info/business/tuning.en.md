## How to Tune the Car?

1. Once you arrive at the tuning garage, entry will be done using the /enter command or by pressing the LALT key.
2. The component selection menu is positioned on the right side and will list all component categories (wheels, nitro, hydraulics, etc.).
3. If the name of a category is red, then there are no tuning components in that category compatible with the vehicle.
4. To choose a tuning component from a certain category, click on the name of the desired category, and you will be listed all the components compatible with your vehicle from that category.
5. To return to the list of component categories, you can press the Back button. To select and install a component on the vehicle, click on its name.
6. When you install a certain tuning component, the camera will automatically position itself so that you have perfect visibility.
7. The amount of money is calculated and displayed above the menu as you install tuning components on the vehicle. To finalize your purchases, press the BUY button. To leave the tuning garage without causing any changes to the vehicle, you can press the ESC button on the keyboard.

## Premium Vehicles

- Only premium vehicles (Infernus, Cheetah, Banshee, Turismo, Bullet, all types of Monster Trucks, all types of Hotring) will be able to have neons installed.
- If a vehicle has neons installed, the driver will have a new option for /tog, called "Vehicle Neons", with which they can turn on/off the neons.
- You should keep in mind that neons do not shine at certain times of the day. They are usually visible in the morning, evening and only in some cases during the day.
