Loot represents the items that the player can find on the map to help them survive longer in the arena.

- **High Loot:** represents abundant loot areas, in popular zones, with loot between 21-50 items.
- **Medium Loot:** represents medium loot area, in classic zones, with loot between 11-20 items.
- **Low Loot:** represents low loot area, in peripheral zones, with loot between 3-10 items.

On the map there are also spawned vehicles in High Loot and Medium Loot areas.

Found items can be collected from the ground using the N key and being equipped or stored in inventory.

The inventory has a stock capacity of 350 units.

## Map

This represents the area where the match takes place.

Depending on the number of participating players, the arena will automatically determine whether a game is needed on all 3 cities or on a single city.

The map consists of 3 main zones:

- **Safe Zone:** inside the blue circle; area where you are protected from the map's danger, but not from other players.
- **Neutral Zone:** the area between the blue circle and the red one; this area temporarily protects you from the map's danger but pay attention to the timer because the area shrinks when time expires.
- **Danger Zone:** the area outside the red circle; this represents the storm area where you will constantly lose HP depending on the stage of the game you have reached (if the circle is large, HP will decrease less and slower, if the circle is small, HP will decrease more and faster).

These map zones continuously change when the time displayed on the HUD expires.

In each stage of the match when the timer expires, the zones become increasingly smaller, gradually shrinking.

## Level

The arena has a level system through which players can advance.

- Currently the character level does not bring any other benefit than visual.
- There are certain actions that if done during a match bring you points that count towards leveling up.
- These points can accumulate only once per match.
