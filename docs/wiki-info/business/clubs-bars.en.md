## General Characteristics

Clubs represent the most important element of nightlife on the B-Zone RPG server. They are used for all kinds of occasions: birthday parties, events, contests or just for fun. They have bars, offering a wide range of alcoholic drinks and refreshments, and non-stop music, using various in-game radios. Clubs are private businesses, so there will always be an entrance fee, decided by the owner.
