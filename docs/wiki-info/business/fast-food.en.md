## Characteristics

- The B-Zone RPG server has a total of 28 FastFoods spread across the map.
- The money that the business deducts when you enter the interior represents only the entrance fee, so to eat (/eat) you pay separately ($60).
- Each FastFood is marked on the map with one of three symbols (see image #2):

    - A pizza slice
    - A bell
    - A burger

## Specific Commands

The business has a single command:

### /eat

By using this command, you will receive 20 health points and it will cost you $60. The command can be used repeatedly until the health bar is full.

For the correct and successful execution of the command and to receive the health points, you must be as close as possible to the text "Type /eat to eat" (see image #1).

*Note: As an alternative to this command, you can use the LALT key.*
