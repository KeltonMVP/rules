## Specific Commands

### /eat

By using this command, you will receive 20 health units and it will cost you $30. The command can be used repeatedly, until the health bar is full.

For the correct and successful execution of the command and to receive the health units, you must be as close as possible to the text "Type /eat to eat" (see image #1).

*Note: As an alternative to this command, you can use the LALT key.*
