## General Description

The Mayor, a position that only a person respected by other players could hold. Seriousness perfectly describes this position. You can obtain it by participating in monthly elections.
In general, a mayor financially helps newcomers and occasionally gets involved in organizing events. Any player can become mayor for a month, only if they meet certain imposed conditions. The central element that defines a mayor is the desire to help and offer the best for the server's players.
City Hall is located in the south of Los Santos city, right next to the police headquarters and manages all 3 cities (Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro). For travel and to carry out activities, the mayor has a limousine (Stretch model), which is parked in front of City Hall. Although City Hall actually represents a faction, the mayor is not allowed to invite other players into it.
