</figure>

* When a player on the server is killed by a civilian or a member of any other faction, apart from Paramedics, they will leave behind a corpse at the location where they were killed.
* A maximum of 20 corpses can exist simultaneously. If a player is killed, but there are already 20 existing corpses on the map, that player will not leave a corpse behind.
* These corpses can be picked up by a medic within a maximum interval of 15 minutes before decomposing.
* The corpse will only spawn if all these conditions are met:
  * at least 1 medic is on duty
  * the killed player is in Virtual World 0 and Interior 0
  * the limit of existing corpses has not been reached (20 spawned corpses)
  * the player has not left a corpse behind for at least 10 minutes
  * neither the killed player nor the one who killed them are part of Paramedics
* When a player who meets all the above conditions dies, Paramedics members will receive an informative message about this. The message will contain the name of the killed player, their ID, the corpse location and the command they must use to head towards that corpse.
