## General Description

Las Venturas Police Department is a governmental institution that eliminates crime from the streets of Las Venturas, with the help of modern weapons and special vehicles under their command.
As with the other local departments, LS Police Department and SF Police Department, the LV Police Department faction is divided into two main teams:

1. Traffic team 
2. S.W.A.T. team

The traffic team is responsible for traffic monitoring and fining players who press too hard on the accelerator and defy traffic rules.
The S.W.A.T. team is made up of experienced detectives who have passed the rank of officers and act to catch all the criminals in the city.
If you have civic sense and like to respect the law, this is your place.
