  <figcaption>#2 Dialog for selecting the desired license and its purchase price</figcaption>
</figure>

- Next to the entrance to the Training Room there is an NPC from which players can purchase or renew the desired licenses directly without having to take a test for them.
- This option is available only if the player has already tried requesting an instructor and within 5 minutes their request was not accepted by any instructor on duty.
- If there is no instructor on duty at that time, the license purchase dialog will be displayed directly.
- License prices are considerably higher than usual at an instructor depending on the player's level as follows:
    - **Flying License:**
        - Level 1-9: costs $4,500
        - Level 10-49: costs $9,000
        - Level 50+: costs $18,000
    - **Sailing License:**
        - Level 1-9: costs $4,250
        - Level 10-49: costs $8,500
        - Level 50+: costs $17,000
    - **Fishing License:**
        - Level 1-9: costs $1,250
        - Level 10-49: costs $2,500
        - Level 50+: costs $5,000
    - **Weapon License:**
        - Level 5-9: costs $5,000
        - Level 10-49: costs $10,000
        - Level 50+: costs $20,000
    - **Materials License:**
        - Level 1-9: costs $4,000
        - Level 10-49: costs $8,000
        - Level 50+: costs $16,000
- Once the desired license is selected from the NPC dialog (see image #2), the available hours for it are automatically set to 100.
