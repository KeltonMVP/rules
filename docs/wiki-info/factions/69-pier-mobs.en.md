## General Description

Starting in 1983, in the northeast of San Fierro, a group of 3 Latin Americans, "Coronas", "Regional Officer" and "Enforcer", gave birth to a gang called 69 Pier Mobs.
Over time, they developed their gang, recruiting new gangsters for future battles. From the very beginning they had disagreements with their rivals in the city, from drug deals to street fights, slowly becoming the most feared gang. The gang has been and is involved in illegal activities such as robbery, blackmail, theft, kidnapping, drugs, weapons, pimping, protection for a fee and, especially, street fighting with other gangs for the conquest of territories. For these reasons, the gang members do not get along well with the law at all, the departments always visiting them in the places where they make their living, and, many times, these visits result in victims on both sides.

Led with tact and patience by their Leader, both in the past and in the present, this gang knows how to dot the i's to come out ahead. Every day, new recruits, called "Primitive", are subjected to various tests to see if they are ready to risk everything for the gang, subsequently becoming "Mummy".

If you want to be part of the new recruits and write history in 69 Pier Mobs, you must have at least level 10, common sense, responsibility and the desire to be in first place.

The main occupations of the mafiosi of B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
