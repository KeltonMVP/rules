## General Description

Avispa Rifa is a Mexican gang, located in the south of San Fierro city. Currently, it has numerous illegal occupations, including arms trafficking, killing people who are on the blacklist, drug trafficking. Mafia members daily demonstrate special skill during fights against other rival gangs.

Skill in handling weapons is the main objective, thus, this objective even becoming a criterion for recruiting new mafiosos. The faction has a fairly spacious parking lot for its vehicles, but also for its use as a shooting range. If you think your forte is fighting with members of other gangs among tall buildings, then your place is in Avispa Rifa.

The main occupations of mafiosos on B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). Everyone's goal is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a well-known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
