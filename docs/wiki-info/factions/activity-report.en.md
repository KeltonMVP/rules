The activity report represents the main activity of a faction member. The member must complete weekly the minimum number of points assigned to the rank and faction they are part of to be considered an active member.

The activity report is mandatory for Peaceful factions, for Departments and for Hitmen.

Factions such as the Mayor and Gangs do not have an activity report per se.

## General Characteristics

- Members with a rank between 1 and 5 must complete a mandatory report within the faction they are part of.
    - Players who join the faction on Wednesday through Sunday will have the activity report for that week optional.
- Each rank is usually assigned a different number of points for the report.
- The activity report is completed from Monday at 00:15 until Sunday at 23:45.
- Leaders and Sub-leaders of the faction are exempt from completing the activity report.
- Admins and Helpers who are part of factions will have a halved activity report.
- The activity report is reset at the end of a week.
- The activity report cannot be completed in advance.

## Completing the Report

- The progress of the activity report can be monitored in-game using the /raport, /myraport or /myreport commands (image #1).
- It can also be monitored on the website in the My Account > Faction > Faction Reports section (image #2).
    - Here you can also view the progress for previous reports, regardless of which faction you were part of (image #3).
- Activity report points are automatically allocated by the server when the player performs a specific faction action that counts towards the report.
- The number of points required for the report specific to all factions can be viewed on the website in the Faction Reports section.

## The Bonus

- Players who complete a double report compared to what is normal receive a bonus worth $25,000.
- Players who have an optional report can receive the bonus if they complete the points for the equivalent of a normal report.
- Players who have a halved report can receive the bonus if they complete the points for the equivalent of a normal report.
- In the case of gangs, the bonus will be allocated at the end of the report week only to players who managed to participate in at least 75% of the wars held that week.

## Leave from Report

- Players can request leave from completing an activity report by opening an inactivity request on the website in the My Account > Faction section.
- <span style="color: red;">Inactivity requests cannot be made for the current report week, only for report weeks that have not started. Therefore, if you are planning a vacation for the following week, it is advisable to open the inactivity request before the start of that week.</span>
    - Case 1: If you did not manage to open the inactivity request on time and the week has already started, you have the option to not finish the activity report and you will receive a warning from the system if you have at least rank 2, after which in the following week you will have to recover the report from the missed week as well.
    - Case 2: If you did not finish the report for the current week and you have at least rank 2, and in the following week you have an accepted inactivity request, you will still have to recover the unfinished report in the week after the inactivity request expires.
- Players with rank 1 do not have the right to open an inactivity request.
- Players with rank 2 are entitled to a maximum of one week of inactivity.
- Players with at least rank 3 are entitled to a maximum of two weeks of inactivity.

## Failure to Complete the Report

- Rank 1 players who fail to complete their activity report will be automatically dismissed from the faction with FP 60/60.
- Players with at least rank 2 who fail to complete their activity report will initially enter recovery mode.
    - This means that in the next report week they will have to recover the unfinished points from the previous week in addition to the points they need to collect from the current report.
- If the player does not manage to complete the report even in the recovery week, they will be sanctioned as follows:
    - Players with rank 2 will be automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.
    - Players with at least rank 3 will initially receive a rank down, and if they still do not finish their report, they will be automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.
