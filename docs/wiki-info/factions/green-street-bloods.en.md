## General Description

Green Street Bloods represents a mafia of African-American origin, located on the outskirts of Los Santos looking from Las Colinas at the bustling city. The gang began to terrorize the city of Los Santos since the 1960s, being one of the oldest gangster groups. The gang members are simple young people, who have been taught from a young age the secrets of handling weapons and illegal businesses, dreaming only of conquering cities through brute force. The numerous crimes committed by Green Street Bloods members have also stood out in police files, they are wanted by all the police in the city of Los Santos. Supreme Chief is the name of the faction Leader and is in continuous search of courageous members who know the art of handling weapons.

The main occupations of the mafiosi of B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
