## General Description

Sons of Anarchy is a faction based on motorcycle club activities, the faction's main activity is stealing motorcycles to impose respect throughout San Andreas state. They also deal with "squeezing" impostors who dare to wear their clothes, leaving them naked and robbed. The faction has three garages where they can deliver stolen motorcycles (Los Santos garage see image #2, Las Venturas garage see image #3, San Fierro garage see image #4). Faction members must have the necessary knowledge to start a motorcycle engine without having the key (skill 4 at the Car Jacker job). Also, if they don't want to be caught and arrested, they will have to be careful around them before stealing a motorcycle, otherwise they risk being chased and imprisoned for their deed. At the same time, faction members benefit from 4 weapon packages (see image #5) to have them if needed in case they are targeted by department members for the illegalities they commit.

**Note:** You will receive the **Sawn-off-Shotgun** weapon only once, meaning in one hand only, you will not receive them in both hands.
