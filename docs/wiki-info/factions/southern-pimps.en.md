## General Description

Southern Pimps is a gang of American origin located in the south of Las Venturas in the Blackfield Chapel area.
The gang was founded by Jizzy in 1995, who, together with a few boys, started robbing banks, casinos, bars and trafficking weapons and drugs. Over time it expanded, and the number of members grew considerably.

Gang members are engaged in the same old habits, but also in conquering rival gang territories. The gang is led by Pimp Boss and his assistant, Pimp. Depending on your seniority and behavior in the gang you are promoted in rank and can receive functions such as trainer or group Leader. Members with more than three months of seniority are core members, and they can attack rival gang territories and are part of the gang's 'tester' team.

To be part of this gang you must be capable of teamwork, show seriousness, activity and common sense, and when it recruits you must make an application on the website where you demonstrate to the Leader that you deserve a chance; once accepted you will be subject to two tests, the one in the rules and the weapons one; if you pass these tests brilliantly, you will be on probation for two weeks.

The main occupations of the mafiosi of B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
