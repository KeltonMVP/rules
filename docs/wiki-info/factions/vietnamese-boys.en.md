## General description

Vietnamese Boys is a mafia originating from Vietnam, with its location in the west of Los Santos city.
The gang has the following illegal occupations: theft, money laundering, killing people who violate their territory, arms and drug trafficking, kidnapping people. All gang members are carefully recruited by the "President", assisted by the "Right Hand", "Brigadier" and "Assault Man" in testing them. The experience, common sense and professionalism of the members have brought respect to this gang, making it a feared gang that can gather all the glory and esteem of a city like Los Santos.
