## General Description

National Guard, a military institution, located in the heart of the Las Venturas desert, in Area 51, ensures control in critical situations. Organized and strategically deployed interventions lead to successful mission completion and danger elimination. Being equipped with fighter jets, Hunter helicopters and vehicles that can cross any terrain and weather, department members arrive on time anywhere, anytime. To enter this army you must have appropriate behavior and language. National Guard has 2 types of training to teach you how to manage in the air, as well as in handling weapons. If you manage to enter this department as rank 1 you will deal with order and discipline in prison. What exactly does this mean? You need to make sure that prisoners receive water/food whenever needed, open their cells at a certain time interval for a break, and so on. Also, prisoners can be punished. If they hit each other, if they hit the bars, they will be punished according to the severity of the situation.

After you manage to advance in rank, namely rank 2+, you will have the opportunity to go after criminals who rob the bank or those who do not cooperate when you are in pursuit of them. Over time, you have the opportunity to advance in rank, but for this you must have seniority, special behavior, appropriate language and be able to work in a team regardless of the situation.
