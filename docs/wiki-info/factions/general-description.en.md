## What is a faction?

A faction represents a group of a certain number of players who interact with each other and have the same goal, depending on the type of faction.

To make it easier for you to understand what a faction means, we can describe it as the equivalent of a workplace where all people must fulfill more or less the same objective and where they work collectively to achieve better development.

There are 4 major categories of factions on B-Zone RPG server:

- Peaceful factions
- Gangs
- Police departments
- Other factions

To be part of a faction included in one of the categories listed above, you also need a minimum level. The minimum level required for each faction can be found on the Factions page of the server website where you play.

## General characteristics

- Any player has the right to apply to a faction.
- Players who are part of a faction usually need to fulfill a weekly activity report.
- If a player does not fulfill the weekly report, but does not have an active inactivity request or other solid reasons, they will be sanctioned by the leader.
- The sanctions that can be applied in a faction are:
    - Faction Warn (FW)
    - Faction Punish (FP)
- Each faction has a special room for training, meetings or other similar activities. Members with rank 4+ can use the /open command near the entrance to open or close the room, which can allow faction members to enter. Inside, the /heal and /buygun commands can be used (at no cost).

### Faction Warn

- Faction Warn is a warning for the position held by the player in the faction. A leader gives a member of their faction a Faction Warn when they violate the faction's regulations, but not in a very serious way that requires the player's dismissal (example: regulation violations due to not knowing the regulations, insulting colleagues, not attending meetings/activities, etc.).
- If a player receives a Faction Warn, they will have to wait two weeks more than the normal minimum time required to advance to the next rank. For department-type factions, other factions and mafias, you need to wait at least three weeks.
- If a player accumulates three Faction Warns, they are automatically dismissed from the faction with 10 units of Faction Punish (FP). If the player is in the testing period (under 14 days since joining the faction), they will be automatically dismissed from the faction with 60 units of Faction Punish (FP).

### Faction Punish

- Faction Punish is measured in units. There is a maximum of 60 units of Faction Punish that a player can have. These units are given when a player is dismissed from a faction due to violating in various ways the regulations of the faction they are part of.
- If a player has at least one unit of Faction Punish, they do not have the right to apply to any faction.
- At each PayDay, each player who has been sanctioned with Faction Punish will have one unit removed.
- If you have a premium account, for every 5 hours played, one additional unit of Faction Punish will be removed.
- Faction Punish is given when a player violates the regulations and must be dismissed accompanied by a penalty.
- Faction Punish units can also be removed by purchasing packages called "Clear 10 FP" from the virtual shop (/shop), using Gold.
- Removing 10 units of Faction Punish from the shop (/shop) costs 200 gold.

## Leaving a faction

### Without Faction Punish

To leave a faction without Faction Punish, you must have been in that faction for a minimum of two weeks and not have accumulated three active Faction Warns. If you meet these requirements, you will be able to leave the faction without Faction Punish.

### With Faction Punish 10/60

To leave a faction with Faction Punish 10/60, you must have been in that faction for a minimum of two weeks and have accumulated three active Faction Warns.

### With Faction Punish 60/60

To leave a faction with Faction Punish 60/60, you must have been in that faction for less than two weeks and have violated the rules or resigned, or have been in the faction for a minimum of two weeks and have been banned for cheats.

## About application

You do not need to create another account, you will use the same login credentials as your account on the server you play on. Before entering your credentials, always make sure the address you entered is the official one.

You can apply to a faction using the FACTIONS tab, finding the factions that are recruiting by looking at Application Status where you will see Closed for factions that are not recruiting and Opened for those that are recruiting. Once you have found your preferred faction with Opened status, you will be able to apply to it by clicking the Apply button if you meet the minimum application requirements for the faction.

The application itself is done relatively easily because you are given a model with sections that you simply need to fill out. For your application to have maximum chances of acceptance, it must be well put together, written correctly, contain enough information so that the leader can find out everything they are interested in about you, and last but not least, be truthful. A weak application means your chances of acceptance are minimal.

### Application response

Depending on the number of applicants to that faction, the response to your application can be received from a few hours to a few days of waiting. When your application receives a response, you will automatically receive a notification on the website. You can also manually check the response to your application by going to your profile on the website to the Faction tab where you will be able to see both the log list from the factions you have been part of and the log list of your applications to factions.

There you will see the status of your application and when you notice that it has been modified, you can click on View to see the leader's response to your application.

### The test

Once you are accepted for testing, you will need to present yourself in-game to one of the faction testers, depending on how the leader informs you in the application or how you are informed in the subforum of the faction you are applying to, and take a theoretical and a practical test.

The theoretical test consists of a set of questions from the general regulations of the type of faction you are applying to and from the specific internal regulations of that faction. How the test is conducted and what the rules are will be presented to you by the tester, and in the case of some factions you will be able to find this information in the faction's subforum.

The practical test differs from one faction to another, and in some cases it may be missing.

Once all tests have been completed, you will receive a response as to whether you were admitted or rejected for the tests.

Leaders, sub-leaders of the faction and players accepted for testing can use the /testers command to view online testers.

## Complaints and Faction Sanctions

As a faction member, you will receive complaints against you from time to time that the leader must analyze and decide whether or not you have violated any rules of the faction you are part of. You will automatically receive a notification on the website when a complaint is made against you, when your complaint receives new comments, or when your complaint receives a response from the leader. As a faction member, you have the right to defend yourself with evidence and useful information in your favor by leaving a comment on the complaint so that it is easier for the leader to respond to your complaint.

## Specific commands
