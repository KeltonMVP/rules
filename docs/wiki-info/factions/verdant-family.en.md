## General Description

Verdant Family is a family of Italian origin located in the city of Los Santos.
This family has illegal occupations such as assassinating people who wish it harm, trafficking in weapons and drugs, money laundering and the battle for control of the city.
Every new member recruited by "Capo Crimini" is properly received. To occupy a place in the bosom of the family you must have respect and seriousness. If you have been accepted you must take two tests, one theoretical and one practical.
The mafia places special emphasis on both tests, which means that to be a good mafioso you must understand that the theoretical test is important, and the practical one is crucial.

The main occupations of the mafiosi of B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
