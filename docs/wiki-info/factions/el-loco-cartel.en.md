## General Description

El Loco Cartel is a gang located in the center of San Fierro city and has origins in the wild Mexico.

The faction seeks to expand, defeating the other rival mafias that want to bring it down.
The name is a tribute to El Loco, a crazy mafioso who beheaded 49 people.
El Jefe, the faction leader, is looking for new applicants to join the organization. The mafia's goal is to train people who know what respect and teamwork are, to manage to turn players into bullet-throwing machines.

The main occupations of mafiosos on B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). Everyone's goal is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a well-known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
