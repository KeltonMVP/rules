## General Description
The Tsar Bratva is a criminal organization being at the same time one of the main criminal groups that make up the Russian Mafia, primarily composed of bandits of Slavic origin, dating back to the 20th century, in the Soviet Union area. Developing progressively and reaching expansion following the mastery of the Russian system, these groups have spread all over the world.

Tsar Bratva was among the first gangs to appear, functioning by respecting the spheres of influence of the areas, by respecting and adaptability to new conditions. An important characteristic for Tsar Bratva is the interconnections with political power, also having business relationships with various organizations.

Tsar Bratva is located in the north of Las Venturas, having as rivals Red Dragon Triads and Southern Pimps, conducting a bitter fight with them for the domination of the city.

The main occupations of the mafiosi of B-Zone RPG servers are wars with other gangs (wars). The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Find out more details about wars between gangs on the Wars page.
