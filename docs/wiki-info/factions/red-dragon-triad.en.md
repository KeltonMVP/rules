## General Description

Red Dragon Triad is one of the most feared mafias in Las Venturas, with its headquarters near rivals.
Are you ready? The best gang in Las Venturas, a gang that focuses on quality over quantity, invites you to participate in various interesting daily activities. Do you think you have what it takes? Dragon Head, the faction leader, invites you to join and become a feared dragon. Red Dragon Triad members must know what respect and seriousness mean. Anyone who doesn't respect this simple rule risks ending up swallowing cyanide, burned at the stake, or through other means of torture.
The faction has an extremely spacious parking lot that can support both a large number of vehicles and a large number of bullets flying everywhere.

The main occupations of the B-Zone RPG server mafiosi are wars with other gangs. The goal of all is to gain supremacy, to occupy as many territories as possible to become a known and respected gang by others. Learn more details about gang wars on the Wars page.
