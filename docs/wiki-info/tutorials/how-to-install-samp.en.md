* The **SA:MP** application

<br />

# Download GTA San Andreas

## Downloading and installing the game using a virtual drive (.iso)
1. To download the GTA San Andreas game, you need the [µTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/downloads/complete/track/stable/os/windows) application.
2. Downloading the iso image is facilitated by [this torrent (magnet) (3.95 GB)](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:6abb5be16784ee66dd2f1dbd5cb86730464974e0&dn=Grand+Theft+Auto+San+Andreas-HOODLUM+&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969) which you need to access.
3. The µTorrent application will start downloading the GTA San Andreas game.
4. After completing the game download, you will find a file named ***hlm-gtasa.iso***. To open this file, there are several solutions, the most efficient being the use of [Daemon Tools](http://www.disk-tools.com/download/daemon) software.
5. After downloading and installing Daemon Tools software, right-click on the ***hlm-gtasa.iso*** file, select **Open with** and click on the field describing Daemon Tools.
6. In a few moments, the computer will behave as if you had inserted a USB stick, and in **My Computer** a new virtual drive will appear (similar to computer partitions, Local Disk D, Local Disk C, etc.).
7. Open the respective virtual drive, which bears the name of the game, and access the ***setup.exe*** file.
8. Follow the instructions provided and install GTA San Andreas. It is recommended, but not mandatory, to install the game on a partition different from the one where the operating system is installed.
9. After completing the installation of GTA San Andreas, access again the virtual drive created at point 6. You will find a folder named ***HOODLUM***, access it and copy the files from its content, then place them in the folder where you just installed the GTA San Andreas game (copy & paste).
10. After completing the previous steps, if you want to remove the virtual drive created at point 6, right-click on it and select **Eject**.
11. Also, the software used to download the game (Daemon Tools and µTorrent) can be uninstalled from the computer's control panel.

*Note: For this installation method you have a video tutorial below.*

## Downloading and installing the game using the executable with automatic installation (.exe)
1. To download the GTA San Andreas game, access [this link (914 MB)](https://b-zone.ro/downloads/GTA_B-Zone_Installer.exe). The browser will immediately start downloading the game.
2. After completing the game download, run the ***GTA B-Zone Installer.exe*** executable.
3. Follow the instructions provided and install GTA San Andreas. It is recommended, but not mandatory, to install the game on a partition different from the one where the operating system is installed.
