* The community's samp servers feature certain radio stations that do not work if you do not have a special plugin installed. To get rid of this problem, access [this link](http://b-zone.ro/audio/) to download the plugin.
* Before starting the plugin installation, make sure the GTA San Andreas game is closed.
* Follow the installation instructions until the installation is complete.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the audio plugin. Now you will be able to listen to all radio stations.
