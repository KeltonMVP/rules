# Egyptian Trader

The skin upgrade system is based on Tickets and Fragments. These are very well known in gaming communities, their purpose being to be collected from various activities such as quests, gifts, marathons and so on. These fragments can be processed and transformed into a Ticket that unlocks a multitude of new things for the player.

* There are **3** types of fragments:
    * Diamond Fragments.
    * Onyx Fragments.
    * Upgrade Fragments
* There are **3** types of Tickets:
    * Diamond Tickets.
    * Onyx Tickets.
    * Upgrade Tickets
* Tickets can be converted at the *Egyptian Trader* near War Arena LV or directly from the Shop. The Egyptian Trader can be found using the command [→ **Important Locations** → **Trader Shop (LV)**. (*see image **#1***)
* To convert a ticket of a certain type (Diamond/Onyx/Upgrade), you need at least 5 fragments of the same type.
* There is no limit to how many fragments or tickets a player can hold.
* The number of Fragments (Diamond/Onyx/Upgrade) held will appear on [/stats](**/gps**]).
* The number of Tickets (Diamond/Onyx/Upgrade) held will appear on [# Skin system
* There are 6 types of skins on B-Zone servers (Starter/Bronze/Silver/Platinum/Diamond/Onyx).
* Unlike Bronze/Silver/Platinum skins which can be purchased from a Clothing Store, <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> and <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> skins can only be obtained through upgrades of the <span style="color:#2c2e2e">**Platinum**</span> skin.
* These 2 types can be unlocked using the Tickets mentioned above and will offer the player various bonuses based on the type of skin worn.
* To form a ticket of a certain type (<span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span>/<span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span>), you need at least 5 fragments of the same type.
* Players can upgrade Bronze skins to Silver using upgrade tickets, then to Diamond and only Diamond skins to Onyx using Diamond/Onyx tickets. Therefore, **Starter** skins cannot be upgraded.
* Different types of skins are marked with different colors in the wardrobe (*see image **#2***):
    * <span style="color:#2c2e2e">**Platinum Skins**</span> - Black
    * <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond Skins**</span> - Light Blue
    * <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx Skins**</span> - Orange
* Also, there is a specific identification text above the head of the player wearing <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span>/<span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> skins.
* Unlike other types of skins, Onyx and Diamond skins **can be traded** with other players.
    * **Note:** If players do not have the same gender (Male/Female) they will not be able to trade with owned skins.

## Diamond and Onyx Skins
* There are a total of 100 Bonuses that the player can discover and enjoy if they own a Diamond or Onyx type skin. These bonuses can create various advantages within a faction or as a player in general.
* If the player upgrades the <span style="color:#2c2e2e">**Platinum**</span> skin to a <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> Skin:
    * The player will have to pay the amount of $1,000,000.
    * The player will have to pay 100 Mission Points.
    * The player will have to pay 1x Diamond Ticket.
    * After upgrading the Platinum Skin to Diamond, the player will receive 2 *random bonuses* from the 100 possible bonuses. These bonuses will be active *only if the player wears the skin while doing a certain activity*.
* If the player upgrades the <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> Skin to an <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> Skin:
    * The player will have to pay the amount of $2,000,000.
    * The player will have to pay 200 Mission Points.
    * The player will have to pay 1x Onyx Ticket.
    * After upgrading the Diamond Skin to Onyx Skin, the player will receive *2 more random bonuses* different from those already received on the Diamond skin. Those already owned will remain intact and 2 new bonuses will be added to the upgraded skin. Therefore, the skin will have a total of 4 bonuses that will be active as long as the skin is worn.
* If the player does not wear the skin then bonuses of any type will not be applied.

## Reroll mechanic
* If the player doesn't like the bonuses received and wants to change them without changing the skin completely, they can change them **using the Reroll option** at the *Egyptian Trader*.
* Note that you will have to pay the full price again and you may receive weaker or better bonuses depending on luck.
* If you choose to use the *reroll option* and own a <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> Skin, you will receive another 2 random bonuses that will replace the existing bonuses.
* Note: Bonuses are random, so there is a chance to receive the same bonuses but with different values.*
* If you own an <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> Skin and use the *reroll option*, all 4 bonuses on the skin will be reset.

## Fusion mechanic

*Players will be able to fuse two <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> skins or two <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> skins regardless of gender and will keep only one skin at the end of the fusion (*see image **#3***).

* The skin not selected for fusion will be <span style="color:#FF0000;">**LOST**</span> upon fusion, bonuses not selected for fusion will also be lost.
**The skin selected for fusion will be the one kept, including selected bonuses (*see image **#4***).
* For Diamond skins, 2 bonuses can be selected from the fused skins, and for Onyx skins 4 bonuses can be selected (including all bonuses from the other skin if the player wants to transfer all bonuses from one skin to another).
* Each selected bonus will display an image with a checkmark next to it (<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/c1m07y25/keep.png" width=25px; height=25px; style="border-radius: 20px">), when all bonuses are selected an image with X (<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5NKJG5xB/lost.png"  width=25px; height=25px; style="border-radius: 20px">) will be placed next to unselected bonuses (those that will be lost upon fusion).
    * You cannot select 2 bonuses of the same type from different skins. Each selected bonus must be unique at the end of fusion.
    * Selecting another skin for fusion while other bonuses have been selected will reset the bonus selection.
**All selections can be canceled by pressing the **Reset** button.
* The fusion price is as follows:
**For <span style="color:#11c8fa">**Diamond**</span> skins the price will be **$4,000,000**, **400 Mission Points** and **3 Diamond Tickets**.
**For <span style="color:#fa8e0a">**Onyx**</span> skins the price will be **$6,000,000**, **600 Mission Points** and **5 Onyx Tickets**.
* At the end of fusion if you had the desired skin to be kept on you, you will keep the skin, if instead you have the desired skin on you and select another skin to keep (you lose the skin you have on you and the kept skin's gender matches your character's) the new fused skin will be set.
    * If you select to keep an opposite gender skin and lose the one of your gender, a skin corresponding to the faction you are part of will be set.
* The fused skin will display on /id the text **FUSED** next to the skin ID, same in the Skin Bubble, if activated it will display under the skin type the text **FUSED**. This will also be displayed in [/trade].
* The **FUSED** status will be reset only if you reroll the skin or lose it in another fusion process.
