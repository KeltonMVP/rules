The Chest System (see command interface in image **#1**) is a system that was created to reward active players on our server and to encourage other players to rediscover the joy of playing on our servers. Players who accumulate a minimum of two real hours played will be able to be rewarded with a Chest from the existing list.


## General characteristics

* The chest has multiple tiers that will reward you with various chests, which contain random prizes, depending on how much time you dedicate to this game. You can unlock chests only if you have real hours played, to unlock the first chest with prizes, you will need to have at least two real hours played on the current day.
* You can complete **only one tier** daily, once you have collected a tier, you can no longer progress in that day with another tier.
* The progress you make in that day can be seen through the Chest HUD (see image **#2**), use the command [→ Chest HUD → Enabled to activate it. Progress can also be tracked through the [/reward](/tog]) command.
* To facilitate easier access to information about this system, the management has introduced a button called **Information**, which will give you all the information about this system and the hours needed to collect a certain chest.
* You can access the system interface with the help of commands: [[/rewards](/reward],), [[/premii](/premiu],).
* The tier and hours accumulated on that day will be reset daily at **23:00**, so to not lose the prize from that day, make sure you collect it by that time.
* When you collect a prize, a global message will be displayed (see image **#3**).
* If you have not collected the prize by **22:00**, an informative text will appear that will inform you every 15 minutes to collect it so as not to lose it.
* Hours played on [/sleep] or standing AFK **WILL NOT be taken into consideration**, only real hours played (hours played on goldaward) will be taken into consideration.
* Players who have a permanent premium account will no longer be rewarded with this prize, but will receive 75 Gold instead.
* To claim a prize such as premium cars (Cheetah, Bullet, Turismo, Banshee, Hotring A, Hotring B, Infernus, Monster A) <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:bold;">you will need to have a free garage slot and premium account</span>, if you do not have any of these facilities, you have the right to reroll to receive another prize.
* Bonuses such as Job Boost and Bunker Sale Boost are valid for 24 hours after receiving them. These bonuses are cumulative with other bonuses you have (example, you have level 110 and already receive 5% Job Boost due to your level, if you win 30% Job Boost, you have a total of 35% Job Boost for 24 hours). The same rule applies to Marathon Boosts.
* From Tier 5 to Tier 10, players will receive a guaranteed prize in addition to the random prize won:
    * Tier 5 - $50,000 Bonus
    * Tier 6 - $75,000 Bonus
    * Tier 7 - 90 Gold and $100,000 Bonus
    * Tier 8 - 110 Gold and $125,000 Bonus
    * Tier 9 - 120 Gold and $150,000 Bonus
    * Tier 10 - One week of Premium Account (if the player has permanent premium account, the prize becomes 75 Gold), 130 Gold and $150,000
* If the player wins a crate, you have an 8,(3)% chance to win a crate out of the 12.
* If the player wins Craftsman job materials, you have a 25% chance to win one type of materials out of the 4.
* If a player wins Rob Skill Up and they have skill 5 at Rob, they will receive a Job Skill Up instead.
* The player is responsible if they claim the prize in time, staff does not offer refunds for lost prizes.
* Vehicle type prizes, which have (Shop) in parentheses, can be sold **ONLY** at the DealerShip for $0. Vehicles (Normal) can be sold to players and at the DealerShip at normal prices.
