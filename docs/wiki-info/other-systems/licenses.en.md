## How do I obtain the desired licenses?
*Using the */needlicense* command in game to request an instructor, followed by taking a theoretical or practical test for the desired license.

*If you don't receive a response to your */needlicense* request within 5 minutes you will be able to get the license from an NPC located at a School Instructors HQ.

*You can renew your license from NPCs using the */renewlicense* command.

**Note:** Players with level 50+, leaders, helpers and admins receive the desired license directly without having to take any test. Exception for licenses taken from an NPC, they will be renewed without any test regardless of level.

## License validity
* The number of hours on licenses decreases by 1 at each PayDay you receive, regardless of whether you are on sleep or online.
* Once you get below 50 hours, you will be able to renew your license by taking the test for the license again (in case you don't have level 50+, leader, helper, admin or don't take the license from an NPC).
