## What is the referral system?
* The referral system is a way you can earn bonuses by inviting your friends to the game. This system will help you level up faster and earn in-game money more easily.


## How do I invite my friends?
* To successfully enroll a player in your recruit list, you need the unique referral ID associated with your account. To find out your referral ID, access the **Referrals** page from your account. To learn more about what you find on the **Referrals** page, visit the My Account article.
* As soon as you have obtained the referral ID, you can distribute it to the friends you want to invite to the game. When registering a new account on one of the B-Zone RPG servers, players are asked if they were brought to the community by someone.
* To appear on your recruit list, players must enter at that moment the code you distributed (the referral ID). As soon as your code has been entered by a player, they become your recruit and will appear in the **Referrals** page table.


## How and how much do I earn?

* You will receive bonuses every time your friends use the */buylevel* command, according to the following calculation percentages:

    * 10% of your friend's respect points (RP) used when purchasing the new level. The value resulting from the calculation will be rounded down. Example: if your friend uses 58 respect points, you will receive 8 respect points. If your friend uses 6 respect points, you will not receive any respect points due to rounding down.
    * 100% of the amount paid by your friend when purchasing a new level. Example: If your friend pays $3,000 to advance in level, you will receive $6,000.
