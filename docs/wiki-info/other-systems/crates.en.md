## General Characteristics

The Crates system offers you the possibility to obtain certain advantages with a success rate preset by the server in exchange for an amount of Gold or Mission Points (MP).

Vehicles resulting as prizes from opening crates cannot be sold to other players and will not generate money income when selling them in the dealership.

To buy a crate you must go to the specially arranged location in San Fierro city.

Prizes are awarded based on chance. If your chance is to win a prize that you cannot receive (you have all prizes from that category, you have permanent premium account, you don't have car slots or similar), you will not be able to win a prize from a higher category.

## Opening crates

To open a crate or view the number of crates held, type the **/crates** command.

By selecting a crate from the list, a green point will appear on your radar. You must go to the location of that green point to be able to find the crate and open it.

When opening the crate, an interface will be displayed and several colors will appear in a roulette. The prize colors are: gray, turquoise, blue, purple, red, in ascending order of their value.

To cancel opening a crate, you can type the */cancel crate* command.
