# E-Mail

A valid and current email address set on your account is very important for your in-game account.


## Importance of E-mail

* Emails for password recovery or account PIN code will be sent to the email address set on your account, if it is not a valid one you will not be able to receive them and you will be able to change it later.
* A **valid** email address helps in case of account recovery by admins. *(if they consider it necessary)*
* If the email address is **validated** on the account, in case your account is hacked/stolen, the email address cannot be changed from the account without confirmation from the current email address.


## Specific commands

### /validate

To validate your email address, use the */validate* command which will send an email with a confirmation link to the address registered on your account. By clicking on that link, the email address will become valid. An email address becomes unvalidated 30 days after the last validation.

If you choose not to validate your account again, you are responsible for a possible account hack, because the email address can be changed directly in the game without any confirmation. The email validation system is a solution to keep your account safe. The */validate* command can be used 15 days before reaching the re-validation deadline.

### /changeemail

For accounts with an unvalidated email address, the */changeemail* command will allow you to change the email address directly in the game.

For accounts with a valid email address, a tutorial will be presented on how to change your email address using the server's Website.
