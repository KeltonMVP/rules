## What is an achievement?
Achievements are objectives that you can fulfill by completing certain tasks. You will be rewarded for completing them.

There are two types of achievements:
* Those that can be obtained only once and others that measure how many times a certain action has taken place.
* For example, an achievement that is awarded only once is to reach level 20, and an achievement that is counted is to organize an event.


## What are the rewards?
* For each achievement there is a reward that is given only the first time that achievement is obtained.
* The reward is worth **10 Gold** and **$1,000**.
* The vast majority of achievements will only be awarded to players connected to the server.


## When do I receive an achievement?
* Assuming an achievement involves being a member of a faction for 5 days, you will receive this achievement only if you enter the game after the fifth day as a member of a faction.
* If you don't enter the game you will not receive this achievement, even if, theoretically, you meet the required number of days.
