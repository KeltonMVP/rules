## General characteristics
* If you have friends and want to have a closer connection with them, then add them to your friends list. All the information you need to know before forming a list of friends is below.
* A regular player can add up to **40 players** to their friends list.
* A player who has a premium account can add up to **60 players** to their friends list.


## How do you add a friend?
* To add a friend to the list, use the ***/friends*** command or the ***Y*** key, after which the friends list will be displayed.
* After opening the table, press the ***Add Friend...*** button.
* In the newly opened box, you must enter the full/partial name or ID of the player you want to add to your friends list.
* After entering the necessary information, press the ***Submit*** button.
* After completing the above steps, the server will send a corresponding message to the player, informing them about the desire to be added to your friends list. If they want to accept this (to become friends), they must use the **/accept friend** command. If they do not want to accept the invitation, they simply need to ignore it and will not be added to the friends list.


## Specific commands
### /friends
This command opens the table with the friends list from where a player can quickly keep in touch with them. The friends list (/friends) will display friends ordered by status (online, AFK, offline). Also, online and AFK friends will be ordered by ID. As an alternative to the command, you can use the ***Y*** key.


## Advantages
* Having a player on your friends list makes it much easier to contact them (SMS or call) directly from the table displayed by the */friends* command.
* By typing the /friends command, you quickly find out whether a player on your friends list is connected to the server or not.
* When a friend connects to the server, you will receive a corresponding notification.
