A Payday is similar to a salary in real life. All connected players receive it at the same time, once every 60 minutes.


## General Characteristics

* Payday is given every hour on the hour (XX:00).
* At each payday you receive: the salary from that hour (+bonus for premium accounts), a respect point, a robbery point, an escape point, **minus** one FactionPunish point, an *accept point* (for rank 3+ police officers) and a certain bonus if applicable.
* Players who have a premium account receive 25% more, and for every 5 hours played, they additionally receive: a respect point, a robbery point, an escape point, **minus** one FactionPunish point and an *accept point*.
* To be eligible for Payday, you must have been online for at least 30 minutes of that hour.
* Hours played on the server can be increased through two methods: playing and doing various activities on the server, so you can accumulate up to 60 minutes played (one hour) from one Payday to another, or you can stay AFK (or on /sleep) and you will accumulate one third of the time spent on the server (meaning only 20 minutes out of the 60).
* Players on /sleep (AFK) also receive Payday, but do not benefit from the financial advantages.
* For standard players, the interest rate is 0.01%, but premium account users benefit from a rate of 0.03%.
* Starting from minute :57 of the in-game clock, players will not receive a kick for AFK (regardless of whether they are AFK with wanted, without wanted, or because they have more than one account connected to the server). However, if players do not return to the game even after PayDay, they will receive a kick (but will still receive the PayDay).

**Note:**
Players who have at least **$10,000,000** in the bank and in hand or goods with a total value of at least **$5,000,000** will not receive interest.

Players who are connected to the server with at least *3 accounts** will receive interest normally, the rest of the accounts receiving interest only for **$2,000,000** if the account has a deposited amount greater than that.


## Happy Hour

**Happy Hour** represents the **19:00 - 22:00** interval in which **payday is awarded double**, meaning that all benefits will be received double during this time period.


## Bonuses
Bonuses can be viewed using the commands */tasks, /bonuses or /bonus*.
