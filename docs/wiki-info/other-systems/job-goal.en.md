Job Goal represents a safe to which any player who works at a job can contribute. Each amount earned by players at jobs will also enter this safe.
*Certain jobs are not counted towards this job goal:* **Detective** *(does not offer payment)*, **Lawyer** *and* **Craftsman**. *


## Characteristics
* The Job Goal can be viewed on screen through a HUD (*image #1*), which can also be disabled using the /tog command.
* This HUD is composed of 3 things:
    * **Job Goal:** represents the percentage or amount that players together must reach to be rewarded.
    * **Your Goal:** represents the percentage or amount that each individual player must reach to be rewarded.
    * **Bonus 100 Gold:** represents the percentage or number of Job Goals to which a player must contribute to receive the gold bonus.
        * This bonus is reset every Monday. Therefore, in at least 5 out of 7 days in a week, you must complete and fully contribute to the Job Goal to benefit from this bonus.
* The threshold for the safe for all players as well as the individual threshold for each player can be adjusted by Level 5 Admins depending on the activity on each server.
* The Job Goal is reset daily at midnight.
* When the Job Goal is at 100%, individual contributions can no longer be made to it and you will be able to do that only the next day.
* When the Job Goal is completed, you can receive the rewards whether you are online or offline.

## Rewards
* When the Job Goal on that day reaches 100%, all players who have also completed *Your Goal 100%* will benefit from the following rewards:
    * randomly between 5-10 Gold
    * randomly between 5-10 Respect Points
    * randomly between $25,000 and $50,000
* Players who during a week manage to contribute to the individual threshold in at least 5 days in a week will be rewarded with 100 Gold.
