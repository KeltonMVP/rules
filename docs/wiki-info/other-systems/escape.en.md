If the possibility of ending up in prison is so high and the temptations to commit crimes are at every step, the B-Zone community will provide you with an RPG system to be able to escape from prison. All the details you need to know before starting this risky process on one of the B-Zone RPG servers can be found below on this page.


## General characteristics

* Teams of up to 6 prisoners will be formed, teams that can only be formed in the prison yard. Each team member must have at least 20 escape points to be invited / to create a team (leader).
* Team members will lose 10 escape points when creating the team and another 10 when they manage to escape.
* Players without premium accounts can have 20 escape points, while players with premium accounts have the limit set to 40.
* At each payday, one escape point is received, except for police officers.
* Police officers nearby (15 meters) will be alerted immediately if the /hit command is used, and group members will end up in prison.
* A member can leave the group if they re-enter the prison interior from the yard, if they receive /punish or if they leave the server.
* There can be a maximum of 4 National Guard members in the prison yard at the same time.
* The prison yard will be daytime for a few seconds (from entering it), after which it is permanently night.
* Prison escapes will generate specific alarms. The alarm can be heard by all players inside the jail/jail yard. It will trigger when the fugitives receive wanted for escape and will stop 1 minute later.
* You can report a prisoner who wants to escape using the /snitch command and your sentence will be halved.

## How do you escape?

* Teams will be created through the /escape command.
* Once a team is formed, the team leader (the one who first invited someone to the team) will have to find a free fence.
* The fences will be marked with text and are located at the edge of the yard.
* Once a fence is found, the /hit command must be used to break it and escape.
* When the fence is reduced to 0 resistance (initially having 100, and one /hit reducing 3), group members will exit one by one, at an interval of 5 seconds.
* One minute after breaking the fence, all group members will receive wanted 6.
* They must reach a clothing store without dying or being caught by the police and use /clothes to get rid of wanted and finish the escape.
