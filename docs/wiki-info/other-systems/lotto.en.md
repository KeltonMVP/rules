The lottery system is based on the same system from real life, the 6/49 concept. If you know you're lucky and believe strongly in your chance, we invite you to try your luck at any 24/7 type business.

## How can I submit a ticket?
To do this, you will have to go to a 24/7 type business, type the */lotto* command and choose the numbers that will bring you the winnings at 19:00.

## How will the numbers be drawn?
Numbers are drawn randomly, from 1 to 49, each ticket having 6 numbers. The draw will take place every Wednesday and Sunday, at 19:00.

## What are the winnings?
The winnings differ depending on how many players participate in the lottery and which numbers are winning.

* Tickets with 6 winning numbers: Such a ticket will make the entire Pot be offered to the winner.
* Tickets with 5 winning numbers: Such a ticket will make half of the Pot be offered to the winner.
* Tickets with 4 winning numbers: Such a ticket will make 25% of the Pot be offered to the winner.
* Tickets with 3 winning numbers: Such a ticket will make 10% of the Pot be offered to the winner.

If there are multiple winners, the Pot is divided equally according to their numbers.

## Other information
Winners will be announced on the global chat, and their numbers will also be announced. You can buy as many tickets as you want, increasing your chance of winning. The price of a ticket is $2,000. Winners will receive the prize even if they are offline.

Numbers must be distinct.
