The Safebox system allows players to store weapons, materials and drugs anywhere they want on the map, without fear that they can be stolen by other players.

## Characteristics
* The safebox can be purchased from the Shop at the price of **600 Gold**.
* A player can buy up to a maximum of 50 safeboxes.
* To access a list of owned safeboxes, use the **/safeboxes** or **/sb** (abbreviated) command. By selecting a safebox from the list, you will be able to place, delete, locate or modify the safebox position.
* To be able to modify the position of a safebox you must be close enough to it.
* To open the safebox menu, use the **/opensafe** command or use the **F/ENTER** keys.
* Safeboxes can only be spawned in VirtualWorld 0.
* Safeboxes can only be located when the player does not have an active red point on the map.
* Safeboxes can be opened even during wars on the condition that they were already spawned before the gangster entered the war.
* Each safebox can store at most 15000 units.


## Safebox usage
* The safebox can be renamed by clicking on its name, the new name being able to have at most 30 characters.
* To deposit weapons, materials or drugs in the safebox, the right part of the menu will be used where all these owned things will be displayed.
* Extracting weapons, materials or drugs from a safebox is done by clicking on the element name in the interface.
* When you extract something from a safebox, a dialog will appear asking you what quantity you want to extract from that element. In this window you can type the number of grams of drugs desired, the number of materials desired or the number of bullets desired. You can also use the word **throw** which will throw away all the quantity held from that selected element.
* The **throw** function helps to free up space in the safebox if for example the player holds weapons that they can no longer use, such as weapons specific to a certain faction or rank from that faction if the player is no longer part of such a faction or no longer holds the required rank.

## Usable capacity of each element
* 1 material - 1 unit.
* 1 gram of drugs - 1 unit.
