Wars are confrontations between gangs, as a result of which respect and supremacy can be gained.

## Classic wars

### Conduct and information

* The duration of a war is 30 minutes, and the maximum number of wars that can take place per day in a gang is 4.
* Throughout a war, gang members have the duty to kill as many opponents as possible or to dominate the area to fulfill their goal, that of winning the territory they are fighting for.
* Each war takes place in a different virtual world than the one in which the other players are located so that the wars are not influenced.
* Gangsters manage to annihilate their opponents using weapons such as: Desert Eagle (Deagle), M4, AK47, Rifle, TEC-9 and Combat Shotgun.
* Once they enter the war territory with the gang car they come from, gangsters have 10 seconds to position their cars favorably, and after these 10 seconds they will be automatically taken out of the vehicle if they have not already gotten out.
* Also, once on the turf, a gangster can no longer enter a vehicle under any circumstances.
* A 30-minute war takes place over 15 rounds.
* Once a gangster leaves the turf, they will still be considered on the turf for a few seconds.
* For a gang to win the war, they must dominate at least 8 rounds.
* To win a round, the gang must obtain a higher score than the other in the current round.
* If both gangs manage to obtain an equal score, the gang defending the territory will win the round.
* At the end of each war, the score of the best gangster on the winning team and the weakest player on the losing team is calculated.
* Wars take place on B-Zone RPG servers every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between 20:00-22:00. During summer, wars are held in an interval established following a poll on the website.
* When a gang has a war, members of the respective gangs will see on the game map the territory for which the war is held, oscillating between the color of the offensive gang and the color of the defensive gang (to view territories use the /turfs command).
* During the war, only personal vehicles or vehicles owned by the mafia can be used.
    * **Exception:** Journey, Mr.Whoopee, Coach, Hotdog, Packer, Bus, DFT-30, Dune, Tanker, Petrol Trailer/Article Trailer, Trashmaster, Barracks, Roadtrain, Linerunner, Flatbed and Enforcer.
* Each gang has the obligation to listen to the instructions of the leader and sub-leaders of the faction.

### Weapon distribution

* Gangsters are required to have the ***Arms Dealer*** job when they have an active war.
* Gangsters are required to provide weapons to teammates upon request.
* To sell weapons, use the /sellgun command.
* For the sale of weapons to be possible, gangsters need materials.
* There is the */fput materials* and */fget materials* commands for controlling the gang's materials safe.
* Find out more details about materials by accessing the Arms Dealer job page.

### Drugs

In case a gangster runs out of health, they can use drugs to recover it. Depending on their importance, drugs are classified as follows:

- Marijuana - using the command */usedrugs marijuana* will consume 12 grams from the total drugs held. This drug gives the gangster 5 HP, but also 2% addiction or side effects such as dizziness.
- Cocaine - A player can use this drug by typing the command */usedrugs cocaine*. It will consume 18 grams from the total drugs held, they will receive 20 HP, but also 4% addiction or side effects such as dizziness.
- Ecstasy - This drug can be used using the command */usedrugs ecstasy*. 26 grams from the total drugs held will be consumed, and the player will receive 50 HP. Unlike other drugs, this offers 10% addiction and an unusual side effect. Once this drug is used, the character will automatically fall to the ground for 10 seconds. During this time the /stopanim command is useless.
- Meth or methamphetamine - This drug is the most powerful, but also the most useful due to the consequences. Using the command */usedrugs meth*, 38 grams of drugs will be consumed. The player will receive 100% HP, but also 20% addiction and the inability to move for 20 seconds.

Note 1: There is the */fput drugs* and */fget drugs* commands for controlling the gang's drug safe.

Note 2: This addiction can be reduced at the Los Santos city hospital using the /rehab command.

Note 3: Find out more details by accessing the Drugs page.

### Top Gangs

* Monthly turfs will be reset on the last Saturday of that month and the first two gangs with the most territories will be rewarded with gold, as follows:
    * 1st place will receive **10440 Gold** which will be automatically distributed to all rank 1-6 members in the faction, including the leader.
    * 2nd place will receive **7800 Gold** which will be distributed the same way.
* In case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be made based on the number of wars won, and if it's still a tie, the winner will be chosen randomly.

### Commands frequently used during wars

### /order

The command is used by server gangsters to order a certain weapon package (weapon packages are available depending on the gangster's rank). A single parameter is used to complete the command, the ID of the weapon package.

*Note: There are a total of 4 weapon packages. Usage example: /order 2.*

### /turfs

This command is available to all RPG server players, but is most often used by gangsters. The command itself displays both on the mini-radar and on the entire map from the game menu (ESC-MAP), the territories colored according to the color of the gang that holds it. During wars between gangsters, using the /turfs command shows the involved gangsters as points on the map, colored according to the team they belong to.

### /fvr

Using the command has the effect of respawning unoccupied faction vehicles. It is a command extremely used during wars.

### /f

The command sends a message to the chat of the faction you belong to (only if you belong to one). The command is present in all factions except police departments where /r is used.

*Example: "/f message"*

## Special wars

### Deathmatch War

#### Conduct and information

* This type of war takes place every Saturday, between 20:00-21:00, the territory is located outside the cities<sup>*1*</sup> and has the color of the winning gang.
* Members located on the deathmatch territory are locked inside it and cannot leave it.
* Respawning will take place directly on the territory, at a random position chosen by the server.
* In the case of this type of war, the main objective is to obtain as many kills as possible, deaths being insignificant in declaring the winning gang. Therefore, the gang that will win the territory will be the one whose members add up the highest number of kills.
* Also, the best member in the war (best) will be the one with the most kills, and the weakest member in the war (worst) will be the one with the fewest kills
* After the war ends, all members are respawned, and 10 seconds later the war statistics will be displayed in table form<sup>*2*</sup>.
* Members of the winning gang will be rewarded with a new countable achievement, which can be obtained with each victory of this type.

### Alliance War

#### Conduct and information

* This type of war takes place every Sunday, between 20:00-21:00, the territory is located outside the cities and has the shape of a tricolor, displaying the colors of the 3 gangs that formed the winning alliance.
* Alliances are formed completely randomly when the war starts, forming 3 alliances of 3 gangs each.
* Participating members in this type of war can leave the territory, but cannot cause damage to other gangsters outside of it or from outside of it.
* Each alliance has its respawn points outside the territory, at opposite corners and equal distances.
* In the case of this type of war, the main objective is to obtain as many kills as possible, having as few deaths as possible, all statistics resulting from dividing the number of kills by the number of deaths (called KDR).
* The winning alliance is the one that has the highest arithmetic mean of KDR, therefore all gangs in the alliance must have the best possible scores, because a weak KDR of one gang will drag down the entire alliance.
* Gangs in the same alliance can communicate with each other using the /gc command.
* Gang leaders can change the minimum rank required to use the /gc command by using the /setgc command.
* After the war ends, all members are respawned, and 10 seconds later the war statistics will be displayed in table form.
* Members of the gangs in the winning alliance will be rewarded with a new countable achievement, which can be obtained with each victory of this type.

### General information regarding special wars

#### Generalities

* A new title called "best killstreak" has been added, which will be held by the gangster who manages to kill the most opponents without being killed.
* During wars, gangsters will view various statistics in the bottom-right of the screen, updated in real time.
* To reach the special territory, you will proceed as in the case of normal wars (by leaving the HQ), at which point you will have to choose between leaving outside the HQ as usual, or being teleported to the war location.
* These types of wars take place over a duration of 60 minutes.
* Every time a gangster dies on the territory, they will be placed as a spectator on the player who killed them for 10 seconds and only then respawned.
* When you enter the war, allies and opponents will be presented to you through chat messages.
* Allies (those you cannot damage) will be displayed on the radar in green, and enemies in red.
* This type of war uses free weapons, which you can obtain using the /guns command (through successive dialogues you will choose the main weapon and secondary weapon). Also, at each respawn you will receive the last two selected weapons.
* Both types of wars are **OPTIONAL**, members are not required to participate, they are devoid of any type of vehicles and take place in a unique virtual-world.
* If for various reasons a war is interrupted (unfinished), its statistics will be deleted.


#### Weapon distribution

* Unlike classic wars, where weapons are ordered at HQ through the */order* command, in supremacy wars, weapons are obtained using the */guns* command, which once activated will generate successive dialogues through which the player can choose the first and second weapon (primary & secondary).
* After death, the player will be respawned with the last two weapons ordered using the */guns* command.
* To change weapons, the player can activate the */guns* command and choose the new weapons through the same type of successive dialogue.
