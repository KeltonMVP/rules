The B-Zone team will provide you with a unique and beneficial method to discover the server's features and learn what can happen on one of the B-Zone RPG servers. There are many features that mimic real life, but to know them well enough, you need a wealth of information. The only way to get to know this information is to go through the tutorials directly in the game, in an interactive way. Read the rest of this page's content and you will find out what you need to do to reach the treasure trove of tutorials.


## About tutorials

When you start going through the stages of a tutorial, you should know that some of them are represented only by simple text messages transmitted through message boxes, while others are also practical (to complete them, in addition to reading the information, you also need to perform certain actions, for example: Jobs & Money).


## Available tutorials

* Driving school.
    * Upon completion of the driving school you will receive your driver's license (driving permit) for a duration of **300 hours** (300 paydays received).
* Tutorial vehicles.
* Jobs and money (truck driver job).
