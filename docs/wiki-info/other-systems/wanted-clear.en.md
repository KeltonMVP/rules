These two concepts refer to a player's wanted level (wanted), and the removal of the wanted level (clear). When a player commits crimes, they receive a certain wanted level (wanted), either from a police officer or from the server.


## Reason for granting wanted

Department members are part of well-structured organizations with well-established data, so in order to keep track of players who have committed crimes/violated social rules, they grant them a certain wanted level. The advantage of this wanted level granted by a department member is that if the police officer who granted the wanted level still fails to catch the criminal, they will appear on the police officers' criminal list.


## Does anyone manage not to end up in jail?

If you have been granted a certain wanted level and you wonder if you will escape without being sent to jail, then the answer is yes. The wanted level is counted in the form of stars, which are displayed at the top of the screen (right). Every 15 minutes spent in the game, one star is removed from a criminal. If the criminal gets rid of all stars, they are free and are no longer considered a criminal.

## With or without the right to surrender

- Having the right to surrender means having the possibility to surrender to a police officer, being arrested and sent to jail.
- Not having the right to surrender means that police officers have the right to shoot at you to kill you, and you will be sent to jail.

When a player is killed by a police officer, it is considered wanted without the right to surrender, and the server calculates the number of seconds of punishment from the perspective of a crime without the right to surrender (a longer duration).

If a player is arrested, it is considered wanted with the right to surrender, the server calculating based on this aspect a shorter duration of jail sentence.


## Time spent in jail
Depending on the wanted level and its nature (with or without the right), there are several durations of time for which a criminal can be held in jail:

### With right to surrender
* Wanted 1 (wanted level 1) - 240 seconds in jail
* Wanted 2 (wanted level 2) - 480 seconds in jail
* Wanted 3 (wanted level 3) - 600 seconds in jail
* Wanted 4 (wanted level 4) - 840 seconds in jail
* Wanted 5 (wanted level 5) - 960 seconds in jail
* Wanted 6 (wanted level 6) - 1080 seconds in jail

### Without right to surrender
* Wanted 1 (wanted level 1) - 500 seconds in jail
* Wanted 2 (wanted level 2) - 1000 seconds in jail
* Wanted 3 (wanted level 3) - 1500 seconds in jail
* Wanted 4 (wanted level 4) - 2000 seconds in jail
* Wanted 5 (wanted level 5) - 2500 seconds in jail
* Wanted 6 (wanted level 6) - 3000 seconds in jail

## Clear (removal of wanted level)
This function is usually used when a player's criminal record needs to be cleared for various reasons.

There can be several reasons to remove a player's wanted level, such as:
* Removing a wanted level obtained as a result of abuse by a police officer.
* Clearing a criminal's record due to wrongly granting wanted, but following a new correct granting of wanted (replay).
