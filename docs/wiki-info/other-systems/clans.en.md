## General Characteristics
* Clans have several systems through which they stand out: **the level system**, **the spray system** and **the clan wars system**.
* Clans can be defined as private organizations that are entered based on invitation or application.
* The clans existing on the servers are of size: small (15 slots), medium (25 slots), large (50 slots), mega (75 slots).
* Clans can form alliances with each other using the **/alliance** command.
* Using the **/clans** command you can view a list of existing clans on the server along with some information about them.
* For details about clans in the shop (/shop), visit the page: Shop:Clans.
* Clans whose validity expires will be deleted **after 1 month** from the expiration date if they are not renewed by the leader.


## Level System
* Any newly created clan **starts at level 1**.
* <font color="red">A clan's level is lost when the clan is deleted!</font>
* The current clan level can be viewed using the **/clanxp** command (*image #1*).
** Using the arrows, the other existing levels can also be viewed, how much XP they require and what benefits they offer.
* For a clan to advance in level, it must accumulate a certain amount of XP (*image #1*).
* XP can be accumulated by any clan member who has a minimum seniority in the clan of one day, through various activities that are scored within the server.
* The maximum level a clan can obtain at this time is **level 20**.

## War System
* Clan Wars are unlocked starting at clan level 10, for 5 vs 5 wars, and from clan level 20 for 10 vs 10 wars.
* To be eligible for wars, the clan member must have **at least 300 XP** in the current week. If they don't have this XP, they cannot be added as a participant in wars.
* War participants can be chosen using the **/clanmembers** command by players with the minimum rank that the clan owner has set to have access to this command.
    * The clan owner can change the minimum rank to be able to add/remove war participants using the **/clanwar** command.
* Also on the /clanwar command, the players who have been chosen to participate in wars can be viewed. Selecting a member from this list will remove them from wars.
* Wars between clans take place **Saturday between 15:00 - 16:00**.
* The list of war participants can be changed at any time, except during the war interval.
* The clan must have at least 5 players registered for war to participate
* Level 20 clans that fail to add a total of 10 participants to the list will participate with 5, the rest of the registered players will be eliminated randomly.
    * If a level 20 clan has 10 participants on the list but cannot find an opponent with 10 participants, then it will participate in 5 versus 5 wars and 5 of the players registered on the list will be eliminated randomly.
* A war round lasts 30 minutes and any clan can have at most two wars during the war interval.
* Opponents are chosen randomly. In case the number of opponents is odd, then a randomly chosen clan will be eliminated because it has no opponent.
* Weapons can be changed during the war through the **/guns** command.
* Once you enter the turf you can no longer leave it except through death.
* Damage cannot be caused from outside the territory.
* Respawning on the turf will take place in opposite corners for the two clans, outside the turf.


During the war, every 5 minutes a bonus box will spawn randomly on the turf (*images #9 and #10*). There are a total of 4 types of bonus boxes, with the following characteristics:

* **Normal Box**: 5,000 HP and offers 50 Bonus Points
    * **Master Box**: 10,000 HP and offers 100 Bonus Points
    * **Champion Box**: 15,000 HP and offers 150 Bonus Points
    * **Legendary Box**: 20,000 HP and offers 200 Bonus Points

* War participants can shoot boxes to destroy them. The clan that causes damage of at least half the box's HP will receive the bonus score offered by the box.
* The bonus box score can be attributed to war participants if they cause damage of at least 250 HP.
* There can be multiple boxes spawned simultaneously, but in the graphical interface above the radar you will only be able to see information for the last spawned box.
* The winner of the war will be the clan that achieved the highest result from adding the KDR with the total points accumulated from the bonus received from boxes.
* At the end of the war there will be a graphical interface with the winner, loser, and data about the war.
* Both clans will receive XP attributed to the clan, as follows:
    * **Winner**: calculation formula - **XP max per member * max participants per clan * 2**
    * **Loser**: calculation formula - **XP max per member * max participants per clan**
        * As can be seen, the winner receives double XP compared to the loser.

## Spray System
* There is a system that maintains competition between the clans of each RPG server, based on drawing building walls with graffiti (*image #8*).
* Killing opponents (rival clan members) is allowed as long as you are on duty (/clanduty).
* There are a total of 45 walls on which clan members can inscribe the name and TAG of the clan, 15 in each of the 3 cities.
* To get information about the areas where clan walls are located, the /clanzones command can be used.
* Every day at 19:00 (server time) the gold earnings for each clan will be calculated. The clan that has held a certain zone for the longest time will receive 10 gold. Example: If a clan has dominated 3 zones for the longest time, it will receive 30 Gold. The domination time of a zone will not increase at night (between 02:00 and 07:59).
* The domination time of a zone is calculated in points. There are a total of 540 domination points for each zone.
* To start the wall drawing process, use the /spray command.
* The /spray command only works if you are close enough to the wall to be drawn and if you are on duty.
* The /spray command cannot be used between 02:00 and 07:59.
* Once the /spray command is typed, the player has 90 seconds to finish drawing the wall.
* If clan members fail to finish drawing a wall to 100% in those 90 seconds, the wall will become available for drawing again.
* During the time when members of one clan are drawing a wall, no member of another clan will be able to use the /spray command on that wall.
* The only way to defend the clan's walls is to remove members of other clans from that area, through various methods (for example, killing them).
* When a member of a clan uses the /spray command, an informative message will be sent to the members of the clan that owns the attacked zone.
* A drawing on a wall consists of the clan name at the top and the clan TAG at the bottom.
* <font color="red">Players who are part of departments are not allowed to participate in spray activity.</font>


## Clan Duty
* To become *a clan member on duty*, the /clanduty command can be used.
* Players on duty (clan duty ON) will not be able to receive wanted as long as they are in one of the zones and kill other clan members.
* Players on duty (clan duty ON) who are in one of the zones will not be able to hurt other players who are not part of clans.


## Clan Safe (Gold)
* Only the clan leader will be able to use the Gold earned within the clan.
* The leader can offer gold to their clan members using the /clangoldwithdraw command.
* Using the Gold earned within the clan, a leader can buy a new color for their clan using the /clancolor command.


## Clan HQ
* The clan HQ can be obtained starting at **clan level 5**.
* Only members of the clan that owns it can enter an HQ.
* Members of other clans, whether allied or not with the HQ-owning clan, cannot enter the HQ.
* For forced entry (method available to department members and Hitmen Agency), the /ram command can be used at the entrance of each HQ.

*Note: Using the /ram command to enter a clan HQ is restricted by the regulations of the two types of factions.*

*Note: Clan HQ interiors can be found [here](http://weedarr.wikidot.com/interior).*

### Clan Inactivity
Once a clan is considered inactive, its HQ is taken away so it can be taken by another more active clan.
The criteria for releasing HQs are as follows:

* clan seniority minimum 1 month.
* under 10 members.
* XP accumulated over a month under 11,000.

Only clans that meet these conditions will be left without a clan HQ and monthly XP is reset at the beginning of each month.
Monthly XP can be tracked using the [/claninfo] command in-game or on the website on the clan page. The XP progress section will be visible on the website only for clans under 10 members, with a minimum seniority of 1 month and that own an HQ.

## Clan Vehicles
* Clans can own vehicles **starting at level 6**.
    * The higher the clan level, the more expensive the vehicles it can own. For the maximum price of vehicles depending on clan level, visit the **Level Benefits** chapter.
* The **/cvs** command allows access to the clan garage.
    * From here vehicles can be controlled such as: spawn/despawn, towing, unlocking, selling in Dealership, converting to VIP vehicle, changing VIP text/color, setting minimum rank for use.
* The **/cvr** command respawns all unused clan vehicles.
* The **/park** command is used to park a clan vehicle.
    * Only members who have the minimum rank to drive that vehicle can park it.
* The **/carcolor** and **/hiddencolor** commands will be used to permanently change the vehicle color.
* The **/buyclanvehicle** command will be used at the Dealership to buy a clan vehicle.
* Clan vehicles have preset plates with the clan tag and these cannot be modified.
* Clan vehicles do not have stored mileage, after respawning their HP, tuning, and fuel are reset.
* Clan vehicles can be purchased from the Dealership even if they are not in stock.
    * The stock will display exhausted only for vehicles that the current clan level cannot buy yet. More details in the **Level Benefits** chapter.
* Clan vehicles can be resold to the Dealership for 60% of their value or to other clan owners whose clan has the minimum level for those vehicles and has free slots.
* The owner of these clan vehicles is the clan itself, they do not have an owner on a specific player.
* Clan vehicles lose their hidden color or VIP attributes if they are sold to another clan owner.
    * If the clan is sold in its entirety to another player, then clan vehicles retain their hidden and VIP properties.
    * Vehicles are automatically transferred when the clan is sold through **/trade**.
