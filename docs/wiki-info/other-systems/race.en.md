## Race preparation
To be able to hold a race, participating players must meet the following conditions:

* Both players must own and use their personal cars during the race.
* Players must use cars close enough in price and category (a price difference of 25% is accepted).
* Both players must start from a common starting line.
* Both players must vote for the same type of race.

### Choosing the race type

Before starting the actual race, players will have to choose the type of race they want to hold.
Currently, there are two types of races:

* **Random** - the finish line will be chosen randomly.
* **Custom** - the finish line will be chosen by the player who initiated the race.

If players have chosen to hold a **Random** type race, the server will automatically place a checkpoint at the randomly chosen finish line.

If players have chosen to hold a **Custom** type race, the player who initiated the race will choose the finish point. To do this, the player will have to place a waypoint on the map (ESC > Map > Right click) and return to the game later. The race will only start when both players have confirmed the finish point by using the */startrace* command.

## Race conduct

* After setting the stake, race mode and implicitly the finish line, players will have 10 seconds to prepare for the start of the race.
* After the 10 seconds have elapsed, players will be frozen for 3 seconds, during which time the start will be given.
* The first player to reach the established finish line will win the race stake.

**Notes:**

*If any of the players leaves the vehicle for any reason, the remaining player will automatically win the race, without having to reach the end of it.*

*The race stake will be set by the player who initiates the race through the /race command, the money being automatically transferred at the end of the race.*

*The race stake cannot be less than $1 or more than $1,000 (for players without premium account), respectively $2,000 (for players who have a premium account).*
