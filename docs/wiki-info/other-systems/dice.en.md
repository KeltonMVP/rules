Dice is a new game system that appeared on B-zone servers, played between two players.

## How to play?

* Each player can choose an amount of money to bet, between $1,000 and $500,000.
* To adjust the amount, the "<" and ">" buttons will be used.
* Once the bet is decided, which must be equal on both sides, the Ready button will be pressed.
* If both players are ready, the dice will spin for a few seconds and, at the end, each player's dice will be displayed and the winner will be determined. The amount of money will be automatically transferred from the loser to the winner.


## Specific commands

### /dice & /barbut

* The commands can only be used inside one of the 2 casinos in Las Venturas: 4 Dragons or Redsands West.
* Once the partner accepts the game invitation, a graphical interface will appear.
