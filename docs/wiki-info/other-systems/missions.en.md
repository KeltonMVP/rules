B-Zone RPG servers provide you with a system of captivating and challenging missions similar to those in San Andreas Single Player.
You will be able to find on the game map an icon specific to each character that can offer you missions.

## General characteristics
* Each mission will be offered by a certain character.
* Upon completion of each mission, you will receive mission points and money (#1).
* Upon completion of all missions, the mission cycle can be resumed (you can start again with the first mission).
* Missions are available to all players starting at level 1, with the exception of OG Loc's mission, "Steal the disc", which requires a minimum level 5 and a valid weapon license. Players can drive aircraft/boats even without a pilot/navigation license during missions, cars **CANNOT** be driven without a driving license.
* A new mission can be started only after **4 hours** from the last successfully completed mission. *Note: in case of mission failure, the mission can be started immediately, without waiting.*
* Players will be notified when a new mission is available to them and will receive directions about the location marked on the map as the mission starting place.
* The steps necessary to complete the missions are explained through a permanent legend during the missions.
* At the intersection between Los Santos and Las Venturas, a billboard (#2) has been placed that will display a top 5 with the players who have the most mission points in total and a top 5 with the players who have collected the most mission points in the last 30 days.
    * This billboard only counts points accumulated strictly from performing missions, **not from other sources**, and its update is done every Sunday at 06:00 AM.
