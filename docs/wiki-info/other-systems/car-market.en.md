The Car Market allows players to sell or buy second-hand vehicles more easily, instantly purchasing a vehicle put up for sale without having to chase the owner or even negotiating its price if players want to pay less.

## General Characteristics

* The Car Market is located in Las Venturas city, near the pyramid (/gps: Important Locations).
* Adding or removing a vehicle to/from the market is done through the **/vehicles** command, selecting the respective vehicle and then selecting the desired option. (*image #2*)
* Vehicles added to the market cannot be used while they are there.
* When adding a vehicle for sale, it will be spawned in the parking lot.
* Each vehicle spawned in the market will have a 3D text next to it that includes the price requested by the seller, the Dealership price, Age and number of Kilometers. (*image #3*)
* To get the best spot in the market, thus increasing the chances of it being purchased, you can use the Recommended Vehicle option from /vehicles, which costs 100 Gold and will bring the vehicle closer to the market spawn (*image #1*), also adding more pronounced colors to the vehicle's 3D text as well as on /market.
    * You will not be charged gold if a closer parking spot is not found compared to the one you currently have.
* Vehicles put up for sale by players who disconnect will also disappear, freeing up space in the market.
    * Upon connection, vehicles are spawned back in the market if there are free spots.
* Vehicles in the market cannot be driven and are locked there.
* Interested players can enter them as driver or passenger and will be greeted with a purchase menu (*image #4*).
* You can view using the **/market** command all vehicles added for sale, even those that are not spawned in the parking lot.
* When sending an offer to a seller, they will receive a message in chat with the offer. Each player can see what offers they have received for a certain vehicle from /vehicles.
* If you want to accept a price offer, the deal must be completed through /trade. Direct purchase only takes place when the buyer directly pays at the market the price requested by the seller.
* Vehicles can be purchased starting at level 1.
* Buyers need a Premium Account to buy a sport vehicle.
* Upon sale, hidden colors and VIP vehicle status will be lost.
* Each player can add 2 vehicles for sale for free. To add more vehicles, a fee of 100 Gold will be paid (the vehicle automatically becoming a recommended vehicle as well).
* Vehicles of too large dimensions will be spawned in special parking spots.
