A blacklist system has been implemented for all factions. The Blacklist contains certain players who are required to pay a sum of money to a faction.

## What happens if I don't pay?

In the case of some factions, the player on their blacklist cannot benefit from the services offered by that faction.

* School Instructors: players on the blacklist will not be able to receive licenses.
* Taxi: players will not be able to be transported.
* Hitmen Agency: players will not be able to place contracts.
* Paramedics: players will not be able to receive heal and rehab.

* If you are a member of a faction and you are on another faction's blacklist, you are required to pay the blacklist, otherwise you will be dismissed.
* If you are on a faction's blacklist, you can be constantly killed by members of that faction.

## Specific commands

### /blacklist (/bl) , /myblacklist (/mybl)

* Members with rank 4+ can add players to the faction's blacklist using the /blacklist (/bl) command. Through the same command, all faction members can see who is on the blacklist.
* Each player can use the /myblacklist (/mybl) command to find out if they are on a faction's blacklist and other similar details.
    * For one warning on a faction's blacklist you will have to pay the amount of **$60,000.**
    * For two warnings on a faction's blacklist you will have to pay the amount of **$120,000.**
