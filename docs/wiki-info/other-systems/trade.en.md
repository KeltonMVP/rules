The concept of **Trade** is found in several strategy games, being an easy method to negotiate with other players. This system is extremely simple. The trade system offers you the possibility to make exchanges safely, sharing houses, businesses, vehicles and money.


## How to use it?

To successfully complete a deal with one of the players on the B-Zone RPG servers, follow these steps:

- Type the /trade command, specifying the ID or name of the partner player (*example: /trade Adi007*).
- Immediately, the server will open a simple table, as you can see in the image.
- The table is divided into two equal parts, with your goods on the left side and your partner's goods on the right side.
- To add an amount of money, a house, a business or a vehicle, press the **Add item** button and select one of the specified goods from the open list.
- Once selected, it will appear on the exchange table and will be visible to both participants.
- As soon as both players have finished adding, both must press the **Not ready** button, which will be transformed into **Ready**.
- If both players have pressed the button, it moves to the next stage, verification.
- The server will display a timer that initially indicates 10 seconds and counts down to 0. If something is not right with the exchange, you can cancel at any time during those 10 seconds by pressing the **Ready** button.
- If no participant interrupts the timer, when the 10 seconds are over, a button called **Confirm** will appear. Each player must press it.
- Once this button has been pressed by both participants, the exchange will be successfully executed.

## Command limits
- The maximum amount of money that can be traded in a single transaction is $2,147,483,647.
- Small type clans can be sold for a maximum amount of $10,000,000.
- Medium type clans can be sold for a maximum amount of $20,000,000.
- Big type clans can be sold for a maximum amount of $30,000,000.
- Mega type clans can be sold for a maximum amount of $40,000,000.

## Specific commands
### /trade
By typing this command, the server will invite a certain player to a goods exchange. The command uses a parameter, the name or ID of the player you want to involve in a goods exchange. For the exchange table to be displayed to both players, the invited player must accept the invitation. The /trade command is protected by **PIN**.
