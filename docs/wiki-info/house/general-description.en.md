- Any player who has at least level 3 can purchase a house.
- Each house has an informational text placed next to the entrance door. Looking at the informational text you will find out the following aspects about that house:

    - The ID of the respective house, located on the first line of the paragraph (*House 442, where 442 is the house ID*).
    - The name of the respective house, located on the second line of the paragraph (*House Name, where House Name is the name set by the owner*).
    - Whether the respective house is for sale (*This house is for sale*) or not.
    - The name of the house owner (*Owner: Nic.eXe, where Nic.eXe is the owner's name*).
    - The level you need to be able to buy the respective house (*Level: 7, where 7 is the level required to purchase the house*).
    - The price of the house, being displayed only if the owner has put the house for sale (*Price: $800.700, where $800.700 is the house price*).
    - Whether the house owner has offered the possibility of renting the house. (Rent: $100, where $100 is the amount of money you will pay each PayDay if you rented that house).

*Note: The rent price varies depending on the owner, from $0 to $1000.*

- For a player to keep the house on their account, they need a minimum of 20 real hours played for regular houses. For level 999 houses from the shop, you only need a minimum of 10 real hours played.
- If you do not have this minimum at the end of the month, your house will be taken from your account by the state.
