# Chat

The commands in this category are used strictly to socialize on chat with other players.
There are several types of chats, which differ from each other and which you can access through various commands:

## /ignore

By typing this command, you will be shown a list of all the players you have blocked and who can no longer contact you. By selecting the _"Add player..."_ item, you will be able to add a player ID or their name to add them to the ignore list.
Players on the /ignore list will no longer be able to whisper to you (/w), send you SMS messages (/sms), or call you (/call).
By selecting a player from the /ignore list, they will be removed from the list.

## /say

It is a command equivalent to normal chat, the one you use to socialize and which does not require typing a certain command before the message, but simply writing the message in the game console. Messages sent through normal chat are only seen by players whose names you see.

_Example: "/say message"_

## /s

The command launches your message on a slightly larger radius than /say, being represented by a shout.

_Example: "/s message"_

## /w

The message transmitted by the command represents a "whisper", so you can transmit confidential messages that only the player you sent them to will be able to see. To be able to send such messages you need at least level 3.

_Example: "/w Adi007 This is a whisper", will send the message "This is a whisper" to Adi007._

## /b

The command launches your message on a radius equal to normal chat (/say), but the message will appear in parentheses.

_Example: "/b message", will display "Adi007 says: (( message ))"_

## /f

The command transmits a message on the faction chat you are part of (only if you are part of one). The command is present in all /factions except police departments where /r is used.

_Example: "/f message"_

## /r

The command is only available to members of police departments and has the same effect as /f, namely transmitting a message to colleagues from that department.
It will only work if you are part of a police department (LSPD, SFPD, LVPD, National Guard, FBI).

_Example: "/r message"_

## /c

The command transmits a message on the clan chat you are part of (only if you are part of one).

_Example: "/c message"_

## /ac

The command transmits a message on the alliance chat you are part of (only if you are part of one).

_Example: "/ac message"_

## /cw

The command only works if you are in a car. It transmits your message only to players who are in the same car as you.

_Example: "/cw message"_

## /wt

It represents the abbreviation of the object through which you speak, walkie talkie (radio station). It can be purchased from a 24/7 store. The command only works if you have set a frequency for the walkie talkie using the /setfreq command.

_Example: "/wt message"_

**Note: The command only works if you have at least level 5.**

## /sms

With this command, you can send messages from your mobile phone to another player using their ID or name.

_Example: "/sms 123 hello", where "123" is the player's ID, and "hello" is the message._

## /call

With this command, you can call a player from your own mobile phone using their ID or name.

_Example: "/call 123", where "123" is the ID of the player you want to call._

## /lc

The command can be used by faction leaders and admins 4+ to discuss.

_Example: "/lc message"_

## /al

The command is used if you have sent a report to admins (/report) for various reasons and an admin has accepted your report, so you will be able to talk to them using this command.

_Example: "/al message"_

## /hl

The command is used if you have asked for help from a helper (/helpme) for various reasons and a helper has accepted your help request, so you will be able to talk to them using this command.

_Example: "/hl message"_
