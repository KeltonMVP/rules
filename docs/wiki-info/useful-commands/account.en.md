# Account

The commands in this category are strictly focused on controlling your own account.

## /stats

By using the /stats command, you will find out all the information about your account at that moment.  
The details that the server provides are identical to those you can find directly in your [account](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/my-account) on the website.

## /buylevel

The /buylevel command means buying a level, in the case of the B-Zone RPG server, advancing to a new level.  
Any community player is allowed to use this command and automatically advance to a new level, only if they have the respect points necessary to purchase that level.  
To find out how many respect points you have, use the /stats command.  
If you have more respect points than those required to advance to the next level, they **will be lost** once you purchase the new level.  
For each level advancement, the player will receive **10 Gold** as a reward.  
**Notes:**
- _With level advancement, the price increases calculated as follows: **amount = level*250**._
- _With level advancement, the number of RP required for advancement increases calculated as follows: **required RP = level*4-2**._
- Players who have an active [Premium Account](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/shop) **will not lose** the respect points they have in excess of those required for level advancement.
