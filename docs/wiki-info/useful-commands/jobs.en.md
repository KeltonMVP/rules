# Jobs

To be able to work at one of the jobs available on the servers, you need to know the commands available for them.

## /jobs

This command opens a list of all jobs. The list includes the following details about each job:
- Job name
- The city it belongs to
- Job type (legal/illegal)
- Minimum level required for employment at that job

_Note: To help your imagination, you can find such a list in image #1._
