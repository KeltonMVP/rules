To find out absolutely all the control commands of a business, commands whose meaning is explained on this page, use the "/businesshelp" command on the servers.

## /bizradio

Using this command, the business owner will be able to play a radio station or a YouTube link inside their own business. When a player enters that business, they will hear the radio station or YouTube soundtrack that have been set by the owner. By using the /bizradio command inside a business that does not belong to you, you will be able to control your ability to hear audio streams inside the business.

Also, sound playback can be stopped by the owner using this command.

## /enter

The /enter command is usually used to enter buildings, in this case, businesses. The command is executed successfully (you will be able to enter the business), only if you are close enough to the door of that business.
For a faster execution, you can use the equivalent of this command, namely the **"F"** key on your keyboard.

## /exit

The /exit command is usually used to exit a building, in this case, a business. The command is executed successfully (you will be able to exit the business), only if you are close enough to the exit door. For a faster execution, you can use the equivalent of this command, namely the **"F"** key on your keyboard.

## /sellshares
