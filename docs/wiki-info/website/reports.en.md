## How to report someone?

First of all, to report a player you must log into your own account on the website of the server you belong to. Once logged in, you must access the "Players" page from the website menu, then go to the "Search Player" sub-page and search for the profile of the player you want to report. As soon as the searched player's name is displayed by the automatic search, enter their profile.

To report a player you will need at least level 3.

### Report to administrators

To report the player to the server administration, in the "General Info" sub-page press the "Report this player to admins" button.
The website will redirect you to a simple form that you must complete correctly, thus making the report valid.

### Report to faction leader

To report the player to the faction leader they belong to (this is only possible if the player is not a civilian), in the "Faction" sub-page press the "Report this player to faction leader" button.
The website will redirect you to a form similar to that of reports to administrators, which you must complete correctly, thus making the report valid.
