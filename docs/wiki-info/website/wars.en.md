The wars page is especially dedicated to the RPG server's mobsters. It includes several sub-categories located on the left side of the website:

[**Wars** RPG](http://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/wars)

## Turfs

Here all players can view a map of the game with the mafia territories inscribed on it. The colors of the territories are updated in real time and match those displayed by the /turfs command in game.

Any mobster who holds rank 4 or higher is allowed to attack other mafias. To attack a mafia, the mobster must press on one of the territories on this page, then complete a short form for the attack to be valid. Attackers must do this as quickly as possible, because there is a maximum number of attacks in a day.

## Upcoming

In this sub-page there is a table that informs players about the upcoming wars that will take place. The table presents information such as:

* Name of the territory for which the battle is held
* Name of the attacking mafia
* Name of the mafia defending the attacked territory
* Time interval in which the war is held
* A button to view the statistics of that war

## Top Gangsters

The page contains a table in which all gang members are structured, displaying information regarding wars:

* Number of kills.
* Number of deaths.
* Number of seconds spent in total on turfs.
* Number of wars the respective player participated in
* Total number of points accumulated in wars.

In addition to this information, others of a general nature will also be displayed: player name, faction, level, rank in faction.

## View all

The sub-page contains a paginated table that contains informative columns about all the wars that have already been fought. In addition to the information contained in the table from the **Ongoing** sub-page, the scores of both mafias involved in the war are also specified.

## Interdiction List

This page displays all players who have received a ban in gangs. The table will also specify the date of receipt and the date of lifting the ban, among other general information.

## Interdiction Requests

For a player to end up on the list of those banned from wars, they must first be subjected to a vote. Gang leaders and server administrators will be able to create a new voting session, through which the ban of a certain player will be decided.

* Within a ban request, gang leaders will vote whether they are for or against banning the respective player (leaders have 3 days to vote), taking into account the evidence presented by the complainant.
* If at least 5 out of 9 votes are for banning, the respective player will no longer have the right to participate in wars.
* Also, there is a comment form with which the topic can be discussed.
