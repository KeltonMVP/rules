# Factions

!!! info "Note"
    The list of all server factions can be found [here](../factions/index.md).

## General characteristics

Factions are special groups that server players can join. If you don't want to be simple civilians, you can integrate into a faction. Correlating factions with real life, they represent, to a certain extent, a stable job.

[**Factions** RPG](http://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/factions)

The page has a list with information structured in several tables, each table including:

* Faction name
* Number of members
* Minimum level required to apply
* Application status (open or closed)
* Date and time when applications will close automatically (if a date has been set by the leader)
* A button to apply to the faction

**Note:** Each faction has its name written using its corresponding color.

## How to apply?

To apply to a faction, from this page you must press the **Apply** button located next to the faction name. The website will redirect you to a form that you must complete, and after completion send the application to the faction leader for examination.

**Warning:** When completing an application, don't rush and don't exaggerate with unnecessary details. Use warm and decent language, explaining only the necessary information. A hastily completed and superficially thought application diminishes your chances of being accepted. You must keep in mind that the applications you complete remain permanently stored in the servers' databases and are visible on your profile.

## How to find out if your application has been answered?

The website has a notification system, so each player is notified when a faction leader responds to your application.

## Haven't been accepted?

If a leader hasn't accepted your application, don't worry. Perseverance will lead to results, it's just a matter of time until you are accepted into a faction. When you are rejected, read the leader's response carefully and think about what your application was missing. After you understand the reason for rejection, gather your thoughts and complete a new application. This time, make sure to cover the mistakes from the last application.

## Application example

1. Real age: 17 years old
2. Number of hours per day spent in game: 4 hours
3. Game time interval: Between 15:00 and 19:00
4. Explanations for leaving previous factions:
    * Los Santos Police Department - Being active in this faction means dedicating a large part of your time to the game to complete the imposed weekly report. School will start soon, so I decided to leave the faction and apply to a peaceful one to better structure my free time.
    * Hitmen Agency - I didn't leave the assassins agency voluntarily, but due to repeated mistakes. I made several mistakes that were not in accordance with the faction's regulations, therefore I was dismissed with 3 faction warnings (3 FW).
5. Explanations for sanctions received from admins: I received ajail from an admin 3 months ago for non-RP behavior. The sanction was applied because the policeman who was ordering me to get out of the vehicle in flames made a complaint against me. The vehicle in flames exploded, with me in it.
6. Your description as a person: My name is Adrian, I'm from Arges county and I'm in 10th grade. I love vacations, and I do quite well in school. I'm passionate about action movies and I especially like watching them at a 3D cinema. I'm up to date with technology and I'm currently trying to develop my programming skills. During school, my schedule is quite busy because I have to take care of two important and at the same time hard-to-cover things: homework and friends. When I have more free time (on weekends or vacations), I prefer to spend time going for walks with friends or simply working on personal projects (for example a website, or a server).
7. Are you on another faction's blacklist?: No
8. Do you have English language knowledge: Yes, I have a rich vocabulary, only verb tenses sometimes give me trouble.
