# Tickets

[RPG Website](https://rpg.b-zone.ro/)

The ticketing system has the following features:

## For players:

* The **tickets** tab will display the number of open tickets of all players
* By accessing the **tickets** tab they will be able to see the tickets they have opened or participated in, and will be able to open a new ticket by clicking the **Open a Support Ticket** button.
* A ticket can be opened starting with level 3 and at least 3 hours played.
* No more than 5 tickets can be opened per day.
* No more than 2 tickets can be open simultaneously.
* When opening a ticket, the player will have the possibility to select a department, and depending on it, a set of rules will be displayed that they must read.
* Inside the ticket, the player will be able to see the participants in the ticket and if admins add other participants to it.
* The player has the possibility to close the ticket themselves if they consider they no longer need a response from admins.
* The player will not be able to give more than 3 consecutive answers without someone else answering in the meantime, to avoid spam.

## For admins:

* Depending on the admin level set for a department, admins will have access to see tickets from that department.
* Admins with access to the department can add other participants to the ticket, if it is necessary for them to be involved in it.
* Admins with access to the department can move the ticket to another department if necessary, can close or reopen the ticket, or can use automatic responses for it.
* Admins will be able to view certain actions performed on the ticket such as: closing, reopening, adding participant, removing participant, moving to another department.
* Level 6 admins can create departments with different settings.
* Level 6 admins can create automatic responses, which will help with tickets where responses are repeated.
