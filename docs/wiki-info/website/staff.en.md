The **Staff** page represents the brain of the community. There you can find the names of the most important people on the RPG servers. The entire Staff is made up of administrators, helpers and leaders.

In the left menu, the three categories of people who are part of the Staff are presented. Each sub-page contains informative tables that show the name of the Staff member and the date they last logged in.

## Admins

They are responsible for the proper functioning of the servers, maintaining order so that any player feels safe. Administrators help newly arrived players, occasionally organize events with special prizes, different from other events. On important days such as holidays, administrators are with the players and supervise to maintain decency both in the game chat and in the players' actions.

If you ever find a player who violates the servers' regulations, or who does any action that results in bad things, feel free to use the /report command. The /report command is the command that puts you in direct contact with the server administrators, being the fastest way to contact them. Help maintain order on the server, use /report!

## Helpers

Helpers are small apprentices of the administrators, which is why most often a helper is promoted after a period of time to administrator.

Their function is limited, they don't have as many rights as administrators and are not allowed to use the commands made available through the function for personal purposes. They only deal with helping players, mostly with answering questions from others on the server. To get in touch with a helper, each player can use the /helpme command. A helper always makes sure that players are well informed and speaks to them in a pleasant tone, without offending them.

## Leaders

A leader is a person mainly concerned with the proper functioning of their faction. They have the right to add new members to their faction team and to dismiss those who violate the imposed rules. In addition to the faction's main rules, a leader has the right to impose new rules on their members.
