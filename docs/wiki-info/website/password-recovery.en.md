# Password Recovery

[RPG1 Website](https://rpg.b-zone.ro/)

Players who have forgotten, lost, etc. their in-game account password will no longer be able to recover it if they do not have a valid email address set on the account to which they also have access.

## How do I recover my password?

* The RPG website offers you the possibility to recover your account password through the email address set on the account.
* To do this you must follow these steps:

1. Access the website for the desired server.
2. Go to the **Sign In** section.
3. Press the **Recovery** button and from the displayed list choose **Recover Password**.
4. Enter the name of the account for which you want to recover the key together with the email address set on that account.

**Note:** If the email address entered is not exactly the same, you will not receive the password by email because you cannot prove that it is you.

Once you have received the email, open it and in it you will find the new password automatically set on your account, you use it to connect to the server, and later you can change it in game.
