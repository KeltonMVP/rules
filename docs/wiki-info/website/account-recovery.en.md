# Account Recovery

## How do I recover my account?

* Players who have lost access to their account for various reasons can make an account recovery request by going to the login page and pressing the "[Recovery - Recover Account](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverAccount)" button.
* The link specified above will take you to a page where you enter the current name of your account. In case it has been changed in the meantime, you can click on the link "Can't find your account? Click here". From there you will be able to search for the account by the previous name.
* Within the recovery request, the questions are established by admins and answers as detailed as possible are needed, so that they can establish based on them whether the account belongs to you or not.

Verifications are made by admins 4+ and each question can be validated or invalidated by them, following which a percentage will be established.

* Following the closure of a request with a positive response, the email address set on the account will be replaced with the one completed in the request.

At the time of closing a request, the author will receive an email to the email address completed in the form informing them about the response received and additional details.

If an account recovery attempt has been made and a positive response has been received, another one cannot be made for that account for one year. If 3 consecutive negative responses have been received, a request cannot be created for one month.
