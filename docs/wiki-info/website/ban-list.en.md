# Ban List

Below you can find links to the Ban list:

* [RPG.B-ZONE.RO](http://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/bans/viewall)

If an account has been banned or still is, it will definitely appear in the ban list. The information is presented in the form of a table, each line representing a sanction. The table is structured as follows:

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Banlist_example](/images/wiki/general/Banlist_example.PNG)
  <figcaption>Ban list example</figcaption>
</figure>

* **IP**: This is the IP address of the sanctioned account. The word "Offline" will be displayed if the player was not connected to the server at the time of sanctioning. This information can only be seen by RPG server admins.
* **Player**: This is the name of the sanctioned account.
* **Admin**: This is the name of the admin who issued the sanction.
* **Time**: This is the moment (date and time) when the sanction was issued.
* **Duration**: This is the expiration date of the ban. If the ban is permanent, the word "Permanent" will be displayed.
* **Reason**: This column contains the reason for sanctioning.

Players who believe they have been sanctioned unfairly can request a re-evaluation of the sanction: [Unban Requests](http://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/players/unbanRequests)
