Each player is able to access the "My Account" branch only if they are authenticated using the username and password they also use to access their account on one of the community's RPG servers. On the left side of the site there is a column containing several tabs with which players can find information strictly about their own accounts.

**Note:** You can find out what the usual in-game commands that affect your account are by clicking [here](../useful-commands/account.md).
