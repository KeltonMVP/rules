As the title says, this page contains information about the server's players. There are certain tabs that make up the "Players" category as follows:

[**Players** RPG](http://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/players/online)

## Online players

In this sub-page, players authenticated on the server at that moment are listed. The listing of players is done by categories, depending on the faction they belong to (Civilians, LSPD, National Guard, etc.), each having next to their name, an icon with the skin they are wearing in the game.

## Search player

Any player can perform searches based on a certain name entered in the box on the page. As you type a player's name in the box, the website displays the found results, thus making searching for friends extremely easy. Once the name you are looking for is displayed, you can view their profile with a single click on it. When you enter a player's profile, the menu on the left will display the categories of information you can view about that player, exactly as in the case of the [My Account](my-account.en.md) page.

## Complaints

In this tab you can view all the complaints made by the server's players. The complaints are structured in a paginated table and include the following information:

* Name of the reported player
* Name of the reporting player
* Date and time of complaint creation
* Name of the administrator who provided the final response to the complaint (if they responded)
* Date and time when the response was given by an administrator
* Complaint status
* A button to view the respective complaint

**Note:** Learn more details about complaints by clicking [here](reports.en.md).

Also above the table there is a box with which any player can search for certain complaints based on the name of the reported or reporting player.

## Unban Requests

To send an unban request to the RPG servers' administration, one of the available buttons (Account Unban / IP Unban) will be pressed, depending on the type of ban. Also on this page, all unban requests you have made over time are displayed.

* Requests for unbanning an account can be made after a maximum of 3 days from the sanction date.
* Requests for unbanning an IP can be made at any time and can be re-sent after 7 days from the last unban request.
* Administrators level 4 or higher will be able to respond to unban requests by pressing the **Raspunde/Answer** button.
* Faction leaders can see if faction members have made unban requests in the last 7 days.
