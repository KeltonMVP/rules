Players who own a house can add a special garage from the shop with Gold to house their beloved vehicles.

!!! warning "Warning"
    The gold prices presented on this page are standard. It is possible that in-game products may be cheaper if you make the purchase during a discount period.

## General Characteristics

- Only a player who owns a house can buy a garage in the vicinity of their house (40 units).
- At the time of purchase, the garage position for entrance/exit will be the same position as the location where you are, so choose the position carefully.
    - If you made a mistake with the position, there is no editing option. You will need to repurchase a garage to change the position.
- There are a total of 3 types of garages (see price list).
- Only small or medium-sized personal vehicles can be parked in the garage. Vehicles that are too large cannot be parked there.
- The garage allows repairing a damaged vehicle directly from it for the amount of $200.
- To park a vehicle in the garage, go with it in front of the garage and use the /enter command.
- To select a vehicle from the garage, enter it by pressing F or /enter while on foot, then after selecting the vehicle you can use the **Take** button.
- To leave the garage without taking any vehicle, you can use the **Leave** button.
- To completely remove a vehicle from the garage, you can use the **Remove** button.
- When selling the house, the garage **will disappear.**
