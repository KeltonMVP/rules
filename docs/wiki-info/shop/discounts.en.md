Each item purchasable using the premium currency, gold, has a standard price, but there are periods of time when these items are cheaper than the preset price.

Usually, discounts appear when various important events take place, such as Christmas, Easter, or the beginning of a new season. Each time such actions take place, community members are informed through an announcement published on the main web page, [www.b-zone.ro](http://www.b-zone.ro/) or on the community's official [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bzonero?fref=ts) page.

By selecting an announcement related to discounts, you will be redirected to a page specially created in the announcements category on the forum. The forum page you will be redirected to will include a list of all items that benefit from discounts. Also, the period during which you can benefit from discounts will be specified there.
