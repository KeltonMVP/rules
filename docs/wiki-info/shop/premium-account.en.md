# Premium Account

We all start from the same statistics, but as you progress, if you want to have even more facilities on one of the B-Zone RPG servers, you need to purchase such a package that transforms your regular account into a premium one. To access the community's virtual shop, use the /shop command in-game.

    Learn how you can buy gold by following the steps on [this page](buy-gold.md).

!!! warning "Warning"
    The gold prices presented on this page are standard. It is possible that in-game products may be cheaper if you make the purchase during a discount period.

## Benefit Period

Currently, the server has six packages of this type with different prices and durations:

- One week [Trial] - Free
- One week - 90 Gold
- One month - 320 Gold
- Three months - 840 Gold
- Six months - 1600 Gold
- One year - 3000 Gold

Upon purchasing such a package, the specific premium account features will be automatically made available to you.

You can also combine packages to increase the benefit duration, for example:

Purchasing the first two packages will cost you 410 Gold and you will have premium account facilities for a duration of one month and one week (37 days).

The Trial package can be purchased only once per account, representing the test period of Premium Account benefits.

    Premium Account can be obtained permanently through the bonus system existing on servers. For details, view the Bonus System.
