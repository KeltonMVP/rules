## General Information

!!! warning "Warning"
    The gold prices presented on this page are standard. It is possible that in-game products may be cheaper if you make the purchase during a discount period.

The **HQ Claim** option from /shop allows changing the current clan HQ with a new desired clan HQ.

On our server, there is a vast number of Clan HQs that can be claimed, a total of 71 HQs.

The standard price for changing the clan HQ is **600 Gold**.

To be able to buy HQ Claims, you must be the owner of a clan of **at least level 5**.

The first time the clan reaches level 5, you will receive a free HQ Claim from the server. Subsequent HQ changes will need to be purchased from /shop.

Using the **/claninfo** command you will be able to see how many HQ Claims you have available.

## Usage

- The clan owner can claim an available clan HQ on the map using the /claimhq command at the HQ entrance.
- After using the above command, the HQ will come into the clan's possession.

## How to Buy?

Follow these steps:

1. Access the community shop using the **/shop** command.
2. Select from the displayed list an item whose name follows this model: **HQ Claim - price Gold**.
3. You will then receive a confirmation dialog that you want to purchase this product.
4. If you confirm and click the **Order** button, you will receive 1 HQ Claim.
5. **Congratulations!** You now have the possibility to change your clan HQ.
