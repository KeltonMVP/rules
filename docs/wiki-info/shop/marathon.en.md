## General Information

!!! warning "Warning"
    The gold prices presented on this page are standard. It is possible that in-game products may be cheaper if you make the purchase during a discount period.

The **Marathon** is an automatic event organized by staff and whose duration lasts a whole month.

Any player of at least level 1 is automatically registered and can participate in this event.

All event participants can win one reward for each day of the month if they manage to unlock them.

The marathon interface can be opened in-game using one of the commands **/maraton** or **/marathon**.

## About Rewards

- Players can see all the rewards for each day of the marathon, but the rewards can only be unlocked when that day of the month is reached.
- To be able to claim a reward, you will need to collect the points necessary to unlock it.
- The number of points required to unlock a reward differs depending on the importance of the rewards that day. Smaller rewards will require fewer points while larger rewards require more points.
- If you didn't manage to collect the points necessary to unlock the reward from a certain day, you can continue to collect them the next day because the points remain.
- Points collected extra for a day are automatically transferred to the next marathon day, they are not lost.
- This means you can complete as many marathon days on any day of the month.
- To be able to get all the rewards from the marathon, **it is necessary** to unlock all previous rewards. You cannot skip rewards from one day to take rewards from the following days.
- Once you have unlocked a reward, you will see a **CLAIM** button next to it. You will only receive the rewards when you click the claim button.
- The last available day on which you can claim rewards is usually day number 2 of the month after the marathon ends. Any unclaimed rewards by then will be lost.

## Progress

- In the marathon interface, you will be able to see a progress bar showing which day you have reached in the marathon as well as your progress for that day.

## Obtaining Points

- Marathon points can be accumulated by doing different activities on the server.
- Certain actions offer a maximum number of points that you can achieve in a day to prevent possible abuse.
- To be able to see which actions offer points and how many points they offer, you can click on the **POINTS** button in the marathon interface and you will see a table with the points.

## PRO Marathon

- The marathon runs two versions in parallel:
    - The **STANDARD** version is available to all players for free.
    - The **PRO** version can be unlocked for a fee. The price of the PRO version differs from season to season, so you will need to check in-game what its current price is.
- The PRO version of the marathon offers players many more advantages compared to the STANDARD version, namely:
    - Higher value rewards.
    - The possibility to receive rewards from both versions simultaneously.
    - Even if the PRO version is unlocked late, there is still the possibility to receive the rewards from previous days as well, so no reward is lost.
    - Marathon progress is kept when the PRO version is unlocked.
- The PRO version can be obtained from the marathon interface by clicking the **GET PRO** button.

## Complete Option

- The marathon also provides you with an option to finish the progress from your current day without having to collect points from different actions on the server.
- This option is paid and usually costs **150 Gold**, and its use is done by pressing the **COMPLETE** button in the marathon interface.
- One of the advantages of this option is to help you on days that require too many points and you don't have enough time or if you want to recover lost marathon days.
