A Colored License Plate represents the player's ability to set a desired color for the text on their license plate number.

Such a colored number can be added to your own vehicle in exchange for the amount of **300 Gold**.

## Characteristics

The colored license plate has the following characteristics:

- The colored license plate can be added to any owned vehicle, regardless of whether it is premium or not.
- The colored license plate can have a single color, it cannot be colored in sections.
    - **<span style="color:red;">RPG B-ZONE</span>**
    - **<span style="color:red;">B-ZONE COMMUNITY</span>**
- Special characters **CANNOT** be used in the colored license plate text.
- The colored license plate cannot be styled.
    - Cannot be made bold, italic, underline, etc.
- The colored license plate accepts a **maximum of 10 characters** in it.

Just like VIP text, the colored license plate will also be lost when the vehicle is sold to another player and must be purchased again if desired.

## How to Add a Colored License Plate?

To add a colored license plate, you need the amount of 300 Gold in your account at the time of purchase and to follow these steps:

1. Use the /vehicles command
2. Choose the desired vehicle.
3. Choose the option 'Add colored license plate to car'.

Once you confirm that you are sure of this purchase, you will receive a preset color on the car's license plate number, this being one preset by the server.

Also from the /vehicles command you will find a new option for modifying it, namely 'Change License Plate'.

This option will display 3 other available options:

- **Edit License Plate:** with which you can change the text on it.
- **Custom Color for Plate:** with which you can choose a desired color for the license plate number in **RRGGBB** format
    - The desired color code is always entered between braces.
- **Default Color Palette for Plate:** with which you can choose a plate color from a list of colors preset by the server.
