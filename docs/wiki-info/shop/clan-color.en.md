## General Information

!!! warning "Warning"
    The gold prices presented on this page are standard. It is possible that in-game products may be cheaper if you make the purchase during a discount period.

The **Clan Color** option from /shop allows changing the specific color of the clan.

The specific color is found in the TAG and clan name: at the player's name, on the HQ wall, on the wall of owned territories.

The standard price for changing the clan color is **400 Gold**.

The first color change for clans is free and is done through the **/clancolor** command, where you will need to enter a **HEX code** for the desired color. You will also see a color preview and a confirmation message before the color changes.

You can find a bunch of websites by simply searching Google for "hex picker". If you don't want to manually search for such sites, you can go directly here: [HTML Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)

- You will then need to choose the desired color by clicking on it.
- On the right side you will then see a preview of the selected color, as well as the HEX code. In our case, the HEX code is **3399FF for blue**.
- Now that you have the HEX code, you can use the **/clancolor 3399FF** command in-game to change the color.

!!! danger "Warning"
    For the HEX code to work in-game, you must always write it in CAPITAL LETTERS.
