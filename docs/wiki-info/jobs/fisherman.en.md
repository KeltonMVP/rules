* ***Tier 1 Equipment:* Each item (Hat, Suit, Boots, Rod and Bait) offers a *+3% chance* increase, up to a maximum of *+15% chance* when fully equipped.

* Only equipment whose durability is below 80% can be repaired.

* Players can track in real time the durability of each piece of fishing equipment from the inventory interface [''/jobinventory''].
* Players can fish continuously as long as the necessary equipment is equipped.

## Ground Fishing Mechanics

* Players will have to control a radar marker and must keep it in the green capture zone using keys in real time.
* A dynamic progress bar visually tracks the success of the fishing attempt.
* Fish can now resist your pull, requiring multiple attempts to succeed.
* Poor synchronization or deviation into orange/red zones triggers penalties or knockback effects.
* Critical pulls offer bonus progress based on your Fishing Skill level.
* The fish's position on the progress bar updates in real time to reflect your performance.
* Each attempt is limited by a timer, adding urgency and pressure.
* A higher Fishing Skill level improves radar control, increases critical pull chance, and reduces both the chance and strength of fish resistance.

## Boat Fishing Mechanics

This method of boat fishing is more advantageous than ground fishing. It requires skill 3+ to be able to fish by boat in certain special maritime zones and a complex capture mechanic.

### Maritime Zones

* There is a 20% chance that the spawn will be waste.
* Caught fish are automatically added to the respective expedition's catch.

### Catch Sale

* Fish caught at sea can only be sold at dedicated docks in Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas. These are available via GPS → Important Locations → Doc LS/SF/LV.
    * Sale is only possible if the player arrives with the expedition boat.
    * The player receives a 15% bonus compared to 24/7 stores.
    * A report is displayed with profit, total earnings and number of fish sold.

## Skill Advancement

* Skill advancement is done at a certain number of accumulated points calculated with the following formula: *'number_of_points*' = ''Tier_XP_Factor'' x ''Fish_Quantity''.
* The XP factor of each tier is as follows:
    * *Tier 1 Fish -* factor = *0.1*.
    * *Tier 2 Fish -* factor = *0.2*.
    * *Tier 3 Fish -* factor = *0.2*.
    * *Tier 4 Fish -* factor = *0.3*.
    * *Tier 5 Fish -* factor = *0.3*.
    * *Tier 6 Fish -* factor = *0.4*.
    * *Tier 7 Fish -* factor = *0.5*.
    * *Tier 8 Fish -* factor = *0.6*.
    * Specifically, let's say we have 5 tier 5 fish in inventory, the skill points we receive will be calculated as follows: *5 x 0.5 = 2.5* => *3 skill points*.
    * *If the number of points you obtain from the calculation is 0, you will receive 1 skill point.*
    * <span style="color:#8B0000;font-weight:bold;">The same number of points also applies to marathon points or clan xp</span>.
* Points required for advancement are as follows:
    * Skill 1 *>>* Skill 2: 50 points. (50 total)
    * Skill 2 *>>* Skill 3: 100 points. (150 total)
    * Skill 3 *>>* Skill 4: 200 points. (350 total)
    * Skill 4 *>>* Skill 5: 400 points. (750 total)
    * Skill 5 *>>* Skill 6: 750 points. (1500 total)
    * Skill 6 *>>* Skill 7: 1500 points. (3000 total)
    * Skill 7 *>>* Skill 8: 2000 points. (5000 total)
    * Skill 8 *>>* Skill 9: 3000 points. (8000 total)
    * Skill 9 *>>* Skill 10: 3000 points. (11000 total)

## Fishing City of the Day

* Every day, at 00:00, one of the three cities becomes the Fishing City of the Day.
* Boat fishing in that city offers an additional 15% bonus at sale.
* The city is announced to all players and marked visibly on the map with a specific icon.
