## Specific commands

### /work

Using this command, the server will provide you with the Trashmaster vehicle to start working. If you are not close enough to the designated location for starting missions, the server will guide you to this area by setting a red point on your radar.

### /dumptrash

This command is used to stop the server from sending you to bins to collect garbage and will set a red checkpoint on the map to guide you to the location where you can unload the already collected garbage. The command can only be used if you have already collected at least half of the total garbage for that route (minimum 10 bins).
