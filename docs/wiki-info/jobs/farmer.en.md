There is one farm in each city. Farmers wake up early and start working so that their skill develops day by day, thus, depending on their skill, they can plant more things. More details about the farmers' life, earnings and skill can be found below on this page.

## General Characteristics

* Each farm has a number of parcels (64 parcels in total).
* A parcel consists of 16 plants.
* A public parcel can be worked by a maximum of 5 farmers simultaneously.
* There are two types of parcels:
    * **Private Parcel - costs 200 Gold for 24 hours.**
        * Los Santos - IDs from **21** to **24**.
        * Las Venturas - IDs from **49** to **52**.
        * San Fierro - IDs from **25** to **28**.
        * The advantage of a private parcel is that it never dries out, you won't lose the rent if you don't plant and you can plant anything regardless of skill.
    * **Public Parcel - costs $1000 for 24 hours.**
        * Los Santos - IDs from **1** to **20**.
        * Las Venturas - IDs from **53** to **64**.
        * San Fierro - IDs from **29** to **48**.
* Each parcel contains a 3D text with information about it (*image #2*).
* Parcels can be rented for 24 hours by going to the 3D text on the parcel and pressing the Y key.
* From the moment of rental you have one hour to plant something or the rent will be cancelled.
* A player can simultaneously own a private parcel and a public one.
* After renting the parcel you must go to the Agricultural business (*biz id 158, image #3*) where you will need to rent the necessary tools and buy seeds.
* Each player can hold 32 seeds of each type of plant. To view the seeds use the command **/seeds**.
* The rent on tools is lost when you lose the rent on the parcel.
* The tractor will spawn automatically when exiting the agricultural business. If you want to respawn the tractor you can select it from the biz, using the /buy command to respawn it without additional fee.
* When getting on the tractor you will receive a checkpoint at the farm to start the plowing process.
* The next stage is planting the seeds (*image #5*), and then watering them.
* After planting you will see a HUD on the screen (*image #6*) with the necessary information about the parcel which can be deactivated using the /tog command.
* The cooking process differs depending on the plant and the humidity of the plants must be monitored otherwise they will dry out.
    * If the plants have reached maturity they will no longer dry out due to humidity.
* If the plants on the parcel dry out, the player will also lose the rent on the parcel.

**Note:** You have available the command (**/tog**) from where you can activate/deactivate the informative HUD for the parcel you own.
