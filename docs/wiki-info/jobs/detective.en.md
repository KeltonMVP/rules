## Specific Commands

### /find

The /find command has a single parameter, namely the ID of the player you want to search for or their name.

*Example: /find Adi007*

Once the command is entered, a red point will be fixed on the map. At the bottom of the screen, the server will display and periodically update the distance between the detective and the target.

Also, when entering the command, the server will provide in the chat as a message the name of the area where the target is located, as well as the city (LS, LV, SF).
