To be able to work at one of the jobs available on the servers, you need to know the available commands for them.

## /jobs

This command opens a list of all jobs. The list includes the following details about each job:

- Job name
- City it belongs to
- Job type (legal/illegal)
- Minimum level required for employment at that job

*Note: To help your imagination, you can find such a list in image #1.*

## /jobhelp

The command displays the list of all available commands within a job.

*Example: Having the Farmer job, the server will display the /work command.*
