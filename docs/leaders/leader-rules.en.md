# Leader Rules

## 1. General Characteristics

### Obtaining the Leader Function

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.1.1</span> Admins with the Faction Manager role (admins 4+) will compile a list of candidates who deserve a chance at such a position, based on a list of priorities and certain basic criteria we wish to see from a candidate.

<span style="color:var(--green);">List priority:</span>

- members who have accumulated considerable seniority (rank 4+) in the faction we are seeking a Leader for.
- former members with considerable seniority (rank 4+), who have left the faction we are seeking a Leader for no more than a month ago, have the second priority.
- members who have accumulated considerable seniority (rank 4+) in other factions of the same type have the third priority.
- anything that does not fit into the above-mentioned criteria has the last priority.

!!! example "Info note"
	We are searching for players with at least 100 days in the faction (besides the rank 4+). This number can be lower if there aren't enough candidates who fulfill this criteria.

	The minimum activity we require is based on the last 3 months, namely the <span style="color:var(--pink);">CURRENT MONTH + THE TWO PREVIOUS MONTHS</span>:<br/>

	- for the two completed months, we require a minimum of 25 hours played in each month, and if the player had an approved inactivity request, we will deduct 50 minutes from the 25-hour minimum for each day of approved inactivity (Example: The player was inactive for 1 week, so we will deduct 350 minutes or 5.83 hours from the 25-hour minimum, resulting in a new minimum of approximately 19 hours for that month)<br/>

	- for the current month, we will multiply the current day's number by 50 minutes to obtain a minimum (Example: Today is the 15th, so the minimum would be 750 minutes or 12.5 hours played). If the player has approved inactivity, we will proceed as above and subtract the inactivity days to get a new minimum.

<span style="color:var(--green);">Base criteria we're looking for:</span>

- not to have any bans, including on secondary accounts.
- not to have recently lost any other functions.
- to have decent activity (real hours played) in the last few months of the game.
- not to have multiple or serious sanctions received in the last 6 months, especially sanctions for behavior or serious rule violations, both on the main and secondary accounts.
- not to have been involved in serious rule violations in the last 6 months, but without being caught and sanctioned.
- not to notice suspicious activity on the account, such as multiple email changes, multiple IPs from different areas, VPN usage, sharing the account with others, etc.
- to generally exhibit decent behavior, if we find indications that the player does not know how to behave, they will be omitted from the list of candidates even if they have no sanctions.
- if the player has held the Leader position for at least 6 months and has resigned or lost it, they must wait a minimum of 3 months to be eligible for a new chance.
- if the player has held the Leader position for under 6 months, they must wait a minimum of 6 months to be eligible for a new chance.

!!! example "Info note"
    Depending on the case, things may vary slightly from what is listed above. There are times when there's a lack of candidates, and we may be more lenient with the criteria. There are individuals who have proven they have no place on the staff team, so we will omit them even if they seem to meet the basic requirements. Similarly, there may be individuals who have proven they've learned their lesson and have made significant contributions, making us want to give them a chance.

    Nothing is set in stone, and everything is decided based on the situation at hand. The staff will always communicate and decide who the best candidates are at that time.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.1.2</span> Once the list is finalized and there are enough candidates, there will be two polls. The first poll will be voted on by all admins.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.1.3</span> Depending on the results, the top 3 most voted candidates will proceed to a secondary poll, which will be conducted for the members of the faction for which a Leader is sought.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.1.4</span> If only 2 candidates obtain the majority of the votes, the poll will be conducted with only 2 candidates. If 4 candidates have a similar number of votes, we will add 4 candidates as much as possible.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.1.5</span> Players on the list are allowed to ask faction members to vote for them, but they are not allowed to buy votes or make false promises.

!!! example "Info note"
	The player who wins the vote will participate in a short interview on Discord with one or more faction managers to get to know the candidate better, understand how well they know the rules, and address any questions they have about the position and similar matters.

### Function Seniority

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.2.1</span> The minimum period you must serve as a Leader to avoid receiving <span style="color:red;">FP 300</span> is <span style="color:var(--pink);">4 months</span>.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.2.2</span> This period is set because we want individuals who take on such a role to understand its importance even before accepting it. No one is obligated to accept the leadership position, you do it of your own free will. However, you must be aware that you need to get involved from the moment you accept it.

!!! danger "Important"
    The Leader position is a privilege we offer you, not an absolute right. We decide who deserves a chance and we also decide who is not performing their duties properly and no longer deserves to hold this position.

<span style="color:var(--green);">Faction Punish 0/60:</span>

- any Leader who fulfills the minimum period mentioned above and who leaves the position through a resignation request will be removed with Faction Punish 0.

<span style="color:orange;">Faction Punish 60/60:</span>

- any Leader who fulfills the minimum period mentioned above and accumulates 3/3 Leader Warns will be removed with Faction Punish 60/60.

<span style="color:red;">Faction Punish 300/60:</span>

- any Leader who does not fulfill the minimum period mentioned above will be removed with Faction Punish 300/60.

### Leader Activity

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.1</span> Leaders are required to have a minimum of 25 real hours played per month (hours without sleep) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn for the first offense, Dismissal if repeated</span>).

- offenses reset after 6 months since receiving the punishment.

!!! danger "Important"
	In the case of an inactivity request, the minimum number of required hours for that month will decrease by 1 hour for every two days of inactivity.

	If the number of inactivity days is odd, the reduction in hours will be rounded up. For example, for 3 days of inactivity, 2 hours will be deducted; for 5 days, 3 hours will be deducted; for 7 days, 4 hours will be deducted, and so on.

	If the inactivity period spans the end of one month and the beginning of another, the number of inactivity days will be calculated separately for each month, and the corresponding number of hours will be deducted from each. For example, if the leader has 6 days of inactivity, with 4 at the end of one month (April) and 2 at the beginning of the next (May), they will need to complete a minimum of 23 hours for the previous month (April) and 24 hours for the following month (May).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.2</span> Leaders who have not logged into the game for at least 3 days without having an inactivity request or notifying the staff about the situation will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, and if repeated with <span style="color:red;">3/3 Leader Warns.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.3</span> Leaders who do not have at least one week of seniority cannot make inactivity requests.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.4</span> Inactivity requests will be made in the dedicated channel on the staff's Discord.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.5</span> Leaders who do not have at least one month of seniority will not be able to make inactivity requests longer than 5 days.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.6</span> Leaders are entitled to a maximum of 14 days of inactivity once every 60 days.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.3.7</span> After the expiration of an inactivity period, the Leader has 24 hours to log into the server or <span style="color:red;">will be dismissed with 3/3 Leader Warns.</span>

!!! example "Info note"
    There can be exceptions to the rules above with the approval of an Admin 6.

### Account Security

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.4.1</span> In case another person gains access to the Leader account, you will be removed from the position with <span style="color:red;">3/3 Leader Warns + Faction Punish (depending on seniority).</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.4.2</span> If abuses occur on the account, whether they were caused by another person or the account owner, <span style="color:red;">a 30-day ban + Faction Punish 300</span> will be issued.

### Leader Behaviour

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.5.1</span> A Leader is obliged to have decent behavior and language wherever they can come into contact with other players or colleagues (in-game, forums, website, or outside the game).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.5.2</span> Insults, mockery, obscene gestures towards other players, or arrogant behavior, mocking towards admins will be <span style="color:red;">sanctioned with Leader Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.5.3</span> Vulgar language, even if censored, will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">3/3 Leader Warns.</span>

!!! example "Info note"
    In case of complaints about behavior outside the game, the staff will decide based on the situation and who initiated it whether the Leader should be sanctioned or not.

    For situations where the Leader was provoked or it's simply a context unrelated to the game, we will not take any action as long as the Leader does not excessively escalate.

    However, our advice is to maintain decent behavior everywhere. If someone bothers you, it's better to block/ignore them and focus on your own affairs rather than complicating matters with complaints that could result in unwanted sanctions.

### Resigning from the Function

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.6.1</span> Resigning from the position is done by creating a resignation in the dedicated channel on the staff's Discord with a <span style="color:var(--pink);">minimum of 3 days</span> before permanently resigning from any activity related to the Leader position.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">1.6.2</span> In the resignation request, you can propose faction members whom you consider worthy of being considered as candidates for the Leader position.

!!! danger "Important"
    The function will only be removed after 3 days from the resignation, during which time you must continue to fulfill your duties in the faction.

    Neglecting Leader duties for the minimum of 3 days can be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Faction Punish 300</span> regardless of your tenure as Leader.

    Even if you have submitted your resignation, until you are removed from the position, you are obligated to continue to adhere to the rules, and you will be sanctioned if you violate them.

## 2. Faction Subleaders

### Choosing Subleaders

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.1</span> A faction can have a maximum of 2 subleaders at the same time (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.2</span> You can choose a maximum of 3 subleaders during a month (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span>).

!!! example "Info note"
    The month period is calculated from the date you promoted your first subleader.

    For example, if you promoted a subleader on October 1st, another one on October 4th, and another one on October 8th, the next date you can appoint another subleader is November 1st, the second one on November 4th, and the third one on November 8th.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.3</span> Rules for choosing subleaders for <span style="color:orange;">peaceful factions, departments, mixt:</span>

- you have a maximum of one week from when you received the position to promote <span style="color:var(--pink);">a single subleader</span> from outside the faction (they must have a previous rank 3 in any faction in the past 2 years) or from among any of the faction members.
- subsequent subleaders will only be promoted from within the faction among members of at least rank 3.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.4</span> Rules for choosing subleaders for <span style="color:orange;">gangs:</span>

- to appoint a member as a subleader, they must have held at least a rank 3 in any faction or at least 35 days in a gang, in the last 2 years.
- a newly promoted Leader has one week to choose their subleaders without being obligated to adhere to the previous rule.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.5</span> Failure to comply with the rules for selecting a subleader will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn + demotion of the promoted player's rank.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.6</span> The subleader does not need to undergo an entry test for the faction if they are brought in from outside, nor should they be listed in the Test Record topic since they are not undergoing any test.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1.7</span> If the subleader has been demoted, they will be eligible to regain the subleader rank after a minimum of one month from the demotion (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn + demotion of the promoted player's rank</span>).

### Replacing Subleaders

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.2.1</span> A Leader can remove the subleader's rank when they consider their services are no longer needed and will demote them by granting a rank based on their seniority in the faction, the number of unlocked bonuses, and the rules regarding rank assignment for a member.

!!! danger "Informational Note"
	As a leader, you can view a field called <span style="color:var(--pink);">Possible Rank</span> in the Faction tab on the player's profile on the website, which indicates the rank you should assign when demoting the subleader.

	If the player has completed more than half of the waiting time for the next rank, the system is designed to round up to the higher rank. If the player's seniority is less than half the time required for the next rank, they will receive the lower rank.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.2.2</span> The former subleader's next promotion will take place normally, just like any other member. The calculation for the next rank starts from the date they were demoted.

## 3. Faction Subforum

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.1</span> Changing the topics within the faction you lead can only be done with approval from an Admin 4+ (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.2</span> Topics are not deleted, they are hidden if you no longer need them.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.3</span> Important faction topics such as Announcements, Records, and so on, must always be pinned.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.4</span> Ensure that all topics within the faction are kept up to date (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> if it continues).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.5</span> When making a change or announcing something, you must notify this at least 48 hours in advance before it takes effect (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> if it continues).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.6</span> Do not allow members to spam in faction topics, especially in the Discussions among Members topic. Eventually, close the topic if there is too much spam and report the respective posts.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.7</span> Leaders must post the sanctions given along with evidence within 48 hours at most (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

## 4. Recruiting Members

### Opening Applications

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.1.1</span> Applications can be opened when there is at least one free slot in the faction or a slot is about to become available.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.1.2</span> Leaders are obligated to open applications and recruit at least 2 players when the faction has 5 or more free slots.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.1.3</span> If the Leader does not have an inactivity request and does not recruit for 5 days when the faction has 5 or more free slots, they will be sanctioned.

Violation of the above rules will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses.

!!! example "Info note"
	The Leader does not count towards the total number of faction members. Therefore, a faction will always have the maximum number of members + the Leader.

### Closing Applications

Applications can be closed when at least one of the following conditions is met:

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2.1</span> When at least 2 players have applied for each available slot.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2.2</span> After at least 2 hours passed since their opening (this rule does not apply when the Leader sets the closure of applications to a predetermined number of applications).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2.3</span> When they were opened strictly to recruit a subleader.

Incorrect closure of applications will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses.

### Answering Applications

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Minimum Acceptance Requirements</span>

- to apply and have a decent application.
- not to have a ban in the respective faction.
- to be sufficiently active.
- not to be on the blacklist of any faction.
- you can accept players without activity in the current/previous month if there are not enough candidates to be accepted at that recruitment session; however, priority for acceptance will always remain for the most active among them.

!!! danger "Important"
    If a player on the blacklist manages to enter the faction, they will either have to pay off their blacklist or be dismissed.

    Players who do not meet the minimum requirements or are accepted incorrectly will be dismissed without Faction Punish, and the Leader will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses.

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Competitive Testing</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.3.1</span> If <span style="color:var(--green);">MORE</span> players apply than there are available slots, and those players deserve acceptance despite the fewer slots, competitive tests will be held (meaning players with the highest scores in tests will remain in the faction).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.3.2</span> If <span style="color:orange;">FEWER</span> players apply than there are available slots, competitive tests are not necessary.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.3.3</span> Players accepted who are to be directly promoted as subleaders will not undergo competitive tests.

!!! example "Example"
    Case 1: a faction has <span style="color:var(--pink);">6 free slots</span>, applications are open for one hour, and 20 applications are received. After analyzing the applications, it is found that <span style="color:var(--green);">10 players can be accepted.</span> Since there are only 6 free slots, all 10 players will undergo the entrance test, and the top 6 with the best results will join the faction.

    Case 2: a faction has <span style="color:var(--pink);">6 free slots</span>, applications are open for one hour, and 20 applications are received. After analyzing the applications, it is found that <span style="color:var(--green);">6 players can be accepted.</span> Since there are 6 free slots and 6 players accepted, all players will remain in the faction if they pass the tests.

Violation of the above rules will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses.

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">The Answer Itself</span>

- the order in which applications are responded to is not important.
- all applications must receive a response within 5 days from the moment they were made (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span>).
- all rejected players must receive a well-founded and concrete reason for rejection (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).
- it is not allowed to reject a player for a reason and accept another player who does not meet the same reason in the same recruitment session (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span>).

!!! example "Info note"
    Example: If you reject a player for a weak application and accept another in the same recruitment session with an equally weak application, you will be sanctioned.

!!! danger "Important"
    Do not cite vague reasons for rejection (such as "I don't trust you," "You're not active," etc.), but provide concrete information (such as "You recently received 10 FWs for behavior," "You have been dismissed multiple times for language," "You have too many sanctions from admins," "You have spent very little time in all previous factions," etc.).

    Applications must be checked for plagiarism before acceptance. [Here is a guide](https://forum.b-zone.ro/topic/465474--) that explains how to check applications correctly. If a Leader does not carefully check applications, they risk receiving a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning or Leader Warn</span> depending on the severity of the issue and the number of unchecked applications accordingly.

### Testing Candidates

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.4.1</span> Only members with a minimum rank of 4 and Tester status can conduct tests with candidates.<br/>
<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.4.2</span> The Leader has the right to decide who is granted Tester status among members with a minimum rank of 4.<br/>
<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.4.3</span> All players who have taken the faction entry test must be obligatorily recorded in the specific test logs topic on the forum by the person who conducted the test (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span> for the tester or <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> if the leader conducted the test).

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Rules for Testing Candidates</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.5</span> Those accepted for tests will undergo a knowledge test of the general rules and internal regulations.

- testers are required to keep records with photo or video evidence throughout the theoretical tests <span style="color:var(--pink);">for 7 days.</span>
    - this evidence must contain proof of all individuals tested, the questions asked to them, and their responses.
    - the evidence will not be published anywhere unless requested by a Leader or admin.
    - in case these proofs are requested and do not exist, the member responsible for the test <span style="color:red;">will be demoted, and the tested member must retake the tests.</span>
- testers must present the test rules before conducting it with the player and ensure they understand it and the situations in which the test can be failed.
- there should be no discrimination or differentiation of any kind between players with the same level of experience or foreign players.
- each accepted player must be given sufficient time to take the tests and have someone to take them with, <span style="color:var(--pink);">having a maximum of 72 hours from the acceptance of the application.</span> It is preferable to specify a contact person and a time slot for them to appear (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn or Faction Warn if they are a tester</span>).

!!! danger "Important"
    In case the test is conducted incorrectly, <span style="color:red;">the tester receives a faction warn</span> and the candidate must retake the tests with another tester and different set of questions.

    In situations where the candidate is active on the server but fails to find any tester to conduct the tests because they are inactive, the testing duration will be extended, and the Leader will be held accountable.

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Theoretical Test</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.6.1</span> The test consists of 15 questions of medium complexity from the general and internal regulations of the faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.6.2</span> Candidates are allowed a maximum of 3/3 wrong points, as follows:

- they will receive 1/3 points for a wrong answer or lack of response within the required time.
- they will receive 0.5/3 points for partially correct answers.
- at 3/3, the candidate will fail the theoretical test.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.6.3</span> Candidates attempting to cheat on the tests will be sanctioned (<span style="color:red;">sanction: test failed + 3-month blacklist + 2x warnings on the blacklist</span>). Reason for blacklist: "Test Fraud - expiration date".

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.6.4</span> Testers who attempt to cheat on the tests or do not conduct them but claim to have conducted them will be sanctioned (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Practical Test</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.7.1</span> A practical test will be conducted if deemed necessary, with no need for evidence from the tester. If a player wishes to report the practical test, they must provide their own evidence.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.7.2</span> The decision to conduct practical tests can only be made by the Leader and must be justified to a faction manager. Furthermore, it must be applied equally to all candidates in the respective recruitment session. For example, if the Leader decides not to conduct a practical test with a candidate from a session, then all candidates accepted in that session must also receive the same treatment.

### Reapplying in the Same Faction

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.8</span> A member dismissed from the faction, voluntarily or involuntarily, is not allowed to be invited with the same account to the same faction from which they were dismissed for a minimum of 2 weeks (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

!!! example "Info note"
    The player accepted incorrectly will be dismissed from the faction without Faction Punish.

## 5. Punishments and Dismissal

### Member Logs

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.1</span> The reasons for all faction logs created on the website must be specific.

Examples:

- sanction: specify the concrete reason for the sanction (language, DM, arbitrary wanted, activity report, etc.).
- sanction removal: incorrect sanctioning or expired sanction.
- promotion: congratulations, minimum period fulfilled.
- rank down: specify the concrete reason for the sanction (subleader change, behavior, language, arbitrary blacklist).
- dismissal: resignation, vulgar language, argument with colleagues, insubordination to higher rank, inactivity, report fraud, reporting colleague on website, blacklist.

Violation of the above rule will be sanctioned (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

!!! danger "Important"
	The reason "PM complaint" is not considered a valid reason.

### Sanctioning Members

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.1</span> All sanctions that a Leader can apply are found in the general regulations as well as the internal regulations of the faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.2</span> A Leader has the obligation to sanction their members correctly when they violate the server's or the faction's rules.

- favoring or discriminating against certain members within the faction will be sanctioned.
- deleting sanctions of a member who has an active complaint or who needs to receive a new sanction is prohibited.
- when deleting a sanction, a promotion, dismissal, etc., the time at which the sanction was received and the invitation will also be taken into account.
- any member who does not leave the faction by resignation but leaves it being sanctioned by the Leader will leave with Faction Punish 10 or 60 depending on the situation.
- members who do not make sufficient contributions to a faction and all they do is occupy space must be dismissed, otherwise the Leaders will be sanctioned.
- members who receive a ban of 3 days or more from admins will be automatically kicked if they buy unban or if they remain banned.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.3</span> DM will be sanctioned only when there is clear evidence (preferably video / multiple screenshots) to prove that the player in question DMed. The informative damage message is not sufficient for dming sanctions (nor the one specifying who killed you and from what distance they did it).

!!! example "Info note"
    Before sanctioning, it's best to consult with an admin of level 4+ if you're unsure.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.4</span> Sanctions offered to members must be posted on the forum within 48 hours of the member being sanctioned.

- if the Leader has an inactive request, they must post the sanctions on the forum within 24 hours after their inactive request expires.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.5</span> Players with multiple accounts (those who own multiple accounts) are not allowed to have more than one account in the same faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.2.6</span> Three different days (IN THE LAST 7 DAYS) of logs (SA:MP Login) are enough to determine that 2 members from the same faction frequently share their account. In this situation, we will consider them as players with multiple accounts in the same faction.

- ask your members who have such accounts which account they want to keep in the faction; if we find out you have such accounts, then both accounts of the respective player will be demoted, and you will be sanctioned.

!!! danger "Important"
    Members promoted before being sanctioned will revert to their previous rank.

Violation of all the above rules will be penalized (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

### Resignation Requests

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3.1</span> All resignation requests must receive a response within a maximum of 48 hours from the time they are submitted, except when the Leader has an inactivity request. In such cases, the Leader will have 24 hours after the end of the inactivity period to respond.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3.2</span> The language and content of the resignation request must be appropriate. If the member insults, mocks, or uses inappropriate language in the resignation request, they will be dismissed with <span style="color:var(--pink);">Faction Punish 60/60.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3.3</span> Members with a resignation request are exempt from mandatory faction activities if the request was made before these activities (meetings, trainings, events, wars, etc.).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3.4</span> It is forbidden to accept resignation requests in the last 2 days of the month for members who are supposed to be sanctioned for their monthly activity. They must first receive their sanction, after which they will be allowed to leave the faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3.5</span> It is forbidden to accept resignation requests from members who have active complaints (either on the website or in private messages sent to the leader). All active complaints must be addressed first, all penalties that the member is supposed to receive must be applied (including those not related to the complaints), and only then can the resignation request be processed.

Violation of any of the above rules will result in penalties (<span style="color:red;">penalty: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

## 6. Complaints and Activity Report

### Website Complaints

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.1.1</span> Leaders are obligated to respond to all complaints addressed to their members within 48 hours of their opening.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.1.2</span> If the Leader has an inactivity request, they will have 24 hours from the expiration of
the request to respond to complaints.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.1.3</span> In the event that the Leader has doubts about the complaint and seeks help from the admins without receiving a response from them within those 48 hours, then that respective duration no longer applies.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.1.4</span> The complaint from a member with an inactivity request will remain open until 24 hours after the expiration of the request.

- during this time, the Leader is not allowed to promote the member or accept their resignation request.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.1.5</span> The evidence in complaints must be valid, meaning: they must belong to the person making the complaint, not be older than 3 days, and include the name of the complainant, the server, as well as the date and time.

- complaints without valid evidence will be ignored.
- complaints without evidence will be ignored.
- complaints can be resubmitted with valid evidence.

Violation of all the above rules will be penalized (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

### Activity Report

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.1</span> The Leader is the one who sets the minimum scores for activity reports and the criteria for awarding points.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.2</span> The report points are automatically corrected by the server, so the Leader does not need to intervene in correcting them, assigning sanctions for reports, and so on.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.3</span> <span style="color:var(--pink);">In the case of gangs, the Leader is responsible</span> for keeping track of attendance at wars and sanctioning members (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.4</span> The Leader reserves the right to dismiss members from the faction who do not contribute enough to the faction (are not active enough, always submit minimum reports, engage in inactivities, etc.).

## 7. Member Promotion and Faction Slots

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.1</span> The durations below are the minimum durations to be awaited. The Leader decides when a member deserves to be promoted.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.2</span> Admins will only make promotions when requested by the faction Leader.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.3</span> The number of promotion days represents the number of days a member must wait from the last promotion to gain the new rank.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.3.1</span> Members can reduce their number of days by unlocking bonuses through the activity report. The bonus can be unlocked between rank 1 - rank 5, and each unlocked bonus decreases the promotion and Faction Warn removal durations by 3 days.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.4</span> Members who accumulate the seniority of ranks 2 and 3 must receive timely rank-ups if their Leader does not have evidence that their behavior has not been quite appropriate or if they have not been active enough (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> for subsequent offenses).

## 8. Extra Rules

### General Rules

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.1</span> Each Leader is obligated to respect the [Server Rules](..), Leader Regulations, their Faction's regulations, and to apply the appropriate sanctions for their violation.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.2</span> A Leader is not allowed to make a complaint against another Leader, including from accounts sharing the same IP address (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> if repeated).
	- if there is a reason for a complaint, faction managers (admins 4+) will be contacted on the staff Discord (private message) with the necessary evidence and reasons.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.3</span> Wiping members without an extremely serious reason and as a last resort is not permitted (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Dismissal FP 300</span>).
	- wipes are only granted with the approval of a faction manager (admin 4+).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.4</span> Leaders are permitted to play on other accounts on the same server with approval from faction managers (admins 4+).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.5</span> A Leader Warn or a Verbal Warning in the Leader position can be removed after <span style="color:var(--pink);">at least one month</span> from receiving it if no further punishments have been issued in the meantime.

- these punishments will only be removed <span style="color:var(--pink);">at the Leader's request</span> and <span style="color:var(--pink);">only</span> with the agreement of a faction manager (admin 4+) if they believe the Leader deserves to have their punishment removed.

- receiving another punishment, Verbal Warning or Leader Warn, will increase the removal time of the old punishment by 7 days.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.6</span> It is strictly forbidden for a Leader to request various compensations for accepting a player into the faction, passing their test, sparing them from sanctions, promoting them, etc. (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> if repeated).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1.7</span> It is strictly forbidden to fraud faction applications (using secondary accounts to apply in order to force the closure of applications or similar situations). If you encounter such cases, contact faction managers to resolve the situation. If you do not do this or it is found that you are involved in the fraud, you will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span>.

### Member Activity

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.1</span> At the beginning of each month, you must verify the activity of members for the previous month and sanction them. This can be done on the website in the Leader Panel, under the Member Activity tab.

Members will be sanctioned as follows:

- under 15 real hours - first offense is a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>
- under 15 real hours - second offense is a <span style="color:red;">Rank Down.</span>
- under 15 real hours - third offense is a <span style="color:red;">Dismissal.</span>
- under 8 real hours - <span style="color:red;">Dismissal from the first offense.</span>

!!! danger "Important"
	Sanctions for activity will only be given to members who have at least 30 days in the faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.2</span> Leaders who do not sanction their members by the end of the second day of the month and begin their sanctions from the following day (for example: 03.03.2021 or later) will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> at the first offense, followed by a <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> at the second offense.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.3</span> Leaders will be required to post monthly evidence of hours on the forum in the specific monthly hours topic created for each faction separately. In that topic, a table with the real hours of your members will be posted.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.4</span> No later than the end of the second day of the month, evidence must be posted (not later). Anyone who is late with the evidence will be sanctioned exactly as mentioned above.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.5</span> To avoid situations where a member had the first offense in 2020 and the second offense in 2022, resulting in a rank down, <span style="color:var(--pink);">offenses are always reset 6 months from the last sanction given</span> for lacking hours played.

!!! example "Example"
	If a member received their first sanction for played hours on January 1, 2023, which was an FW as the first offense, and until August they have no further offenses, but then they need to receive another sanction for not having 15 real hours, they will receive another FW as the first offense because the offenses reset. This reset occurs 6 months from January 1, considering July 1, 2023.

### Organized Activities

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3.1</span> Small errors that may occur when a member of a faction makes an absence request (such as the absence number, rank held, etc.) will not be sanctioned with rejection of the absence request request from the first instance.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3.2</span> For the first offense, the member will be <span style="color:var(--pink);">warned</span> (meaning you inform them of the mistake without a sanction), for the second offense, they will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span>, and from the third offense, they will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warning</span> (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3.3</span> The sanctions for being late are as follows for all factions:

- being late of up to 10 minutes: <span style="color:var(--green);">nothing.</span>
- being late between 10 and 20 minutes: <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning.</span>
- being late between 20 and 30 minutes: <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning + fine of $50,000.</span>
- being late of over 30 minutes: <span style="color:red;">Faction Warning.</span>

!!! danger "Important"
	  An activity with mandatory attendance to which these sanctions apply must last between 40 and 60 minutes.

    Activities with mandatory attendance must be announced at least one week in advance (forum post, FMOTD), and the only way for members to be excused is through an open leave request on the website in advance.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3.4</span> If a Leader wants to organize an activity with mandatory attendance, they must have a well-founded reason (ex: a meeting after a new Leader has been promoted, after major rule changes, etc.) and request approval from a faction manager (admin 4+).

### Gang Rules

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.1</span> If an interdiction request is closed within 3 days without a majority vote from you, you will be sanctioned <span style="color:var(--pink);">verbally</span>, followed by a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span>, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span>, and <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span>.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.2</span> Leaders who knowingly accept individuals using cheats will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn or Dismissal</span>, depending on the case.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.3</span> Leaders and Subleaders are required to be present for at least 3 days of wars per week, whether attacking or defending. Both you and the Subleaders can take leave for up to 2 days of wars, but you are still required to meet the minimum of 3 days.<br/>

Subleaders can use the <span style="color:var(--pink);">2 weekly leaves</span> to take leave, and Leaders must post in the specific channel on the Staff Discord (penalty: <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for the second offense, and <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> if it continues).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.4</span> Members who are part of a gang and meanwhile receive an <span style="color:var(--pink);">interdiction</span> will always be dismissed with <span style="color:red;">FP 60/60</span>. Players who receive an interdiction will be able to be accepted into another gang after a minimum of one month from receiving the ban. Leaders who accept players with interdictions will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span>, even for the first offense.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.5</span> In case there are complaints about <span style="color:var(--pink);">fast c-bug</span> performed by members during wars (both mandatory and optional), where the sanction is Faction Warn, the sanction will be applied only once if the evidence being complained about (from different complaints) is made within a <span style="color:var(--pink);">10-minute interval</span> at that time. If the difference between evidence is more than 10 minutes, they will be sanctioned for each piece of evidence.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.6</span> In case the subleader receives a ban for cheats (<span style="color:var(--pink);">Aimbot/Norecoil</span>), you will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, and a <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.7</span> With every vote you bring to the player whose interdiction request is made, you are obliged to bring an argument for that vote

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.8</span>Gang Leaders who have at least 10 members banned for cheats of aim, norecoil or adjacent in one month risk severe sanctions if this number continues to increase (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Leader Warn</span> or <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4.9</span> Gang Leaders are obligated to have a minimum of 3 attacks each week during war days (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> second offense).

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">Absences</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.5.1</span> All absence requests are done through the website.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.5.2</span> You can accept <span style="color:var(--pink);">a maximum of 5 absence requests</span> in one war day. (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> for subsequent offenses)

- if there are 5 or fewer absence requests, they will be automatically accepted.
- if there are more than 5 absence requests, the first 5 will have priority. If a member who has an absence request has been present at all wars on that day, their request will be rejected.

!!! example "Info note"
	A member is considered present at a war if they have at least 30 seconds on the turf or a minimum of 3 kills/deaths in total.

#### <span style="color:#3baad5;">War Seconds</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.6.1</span> Gang Leaders can set the time limit for attendance at gang wars according to the following formula:

- for wars in the gang's city, the limit can be set between <span style="color:var(--green);">500 - 800 seconds.</span>
- for wars in other cities, the limit can be set between <span style="color:var(--green);">300 - 600 seconds.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.6.2</span> The Leader can decide not to consider seconds for a particular war day, requiring <span style="color:var(--pink);">30 seconds per turf for attendance.</span>

!!! danger "Important"
	  In case of abuses related to this rule, a <span style="color:red;">Leader Warn</span> will be issued directly. Faction managers (admins 4+) can request evidence from the Leader to demonstrate that they have announced the number of seconds.

!!! example "Info note"
	  - the rule aims to impose a reasonable interval of seconds, thus a Leader cannot impose an exaggerated number of seconds.
    - the most important part of this rule is that if the Leader chooses NOT to add seconds for a war day, ONLY 30 seconds per turf are required to be considered present.
    - the rule allows for flexible adjustment of seconds depending on the war/day of war.
    - the rule will require you to provide evidence when announcing the number of seconds for a war or a war day (preferably on /fmotd).
