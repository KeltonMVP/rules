# Peaceful Faction and Mixt Rules

Besides these rules, all members are obligated to respect both the [Server Rules](..) as well as the specific Internal Rules of your faction outlined in the Internal Rules section below.

## 1. Behaviour and Language

!!! warning "Important"
    Language that violates the rules below is punishable even if it is knowingly addressed from secondary accounts to <span style="color:var(--pink);">faction colleagues.</span>

    For the cases presented above, the language used is sanctioned regardless of the language used.

- any conflict between colleagues will be resolved in the presence of faction leadership.
- failure to cease conflict upon intervention by a higher-ranking member will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

!!! danger "Important"
    Members of official clans are allowed to attack members of other official clans inside or near clan areas only when they are involved in conquering/defending that area.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.5</span> abusive use of the command [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/fvr</span>] (respawning vehicles just to disrupt a colleague, spamming it, etc.) will be punished with <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> or <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> for serious abuses/multiple offenses.

## 4. Activity

!!! danger "Important"
    Members who do not make sufficient contributions to a faction and only occupy a spot will be considered inactive (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2.4</span> You can unlock a bonus by completing a report that exceeds the minimum requirement. This bonus grants you $100,000 and reduces both the promotion period and the Faction Warn removal period by 3 days for each unlocked bonus.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2.4.1</span> The number of points required for the bonus will be displayed on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/raport</span>]. Only bonuses unlocked after the date of the last promotion or after receiving a Faction Warn will provide a deduction in days.

        - players of <span style="color:var(--green);">rank 2</span> will be <span style="color:red;">automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.</span>
        - players of <span style="color:var(--green);">at least rank 3</span> will receive <span style="color:red;">initial rank down,</span> and if they still do not complete their report, they will be <span style="color:red;">automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.3.2</span> Players with a minimum seniority of one year in the faction, who have shown seriousness and involvement, are eligible, upon their request, <span style="color:var(--green);">to be exempted</span> from the requirement to accumulate real hours played in a specific month.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.3.3</span> This benefit <span style="color:var(--pink);">can be used only once a year</span> with a one year difference from the previous request, if this is the case, and will only exempt you from the requirement of played hours, not from submitting activity reports for that month. You still need to submit reports or opt for an inactivity request for the allowed period and use optional reports if you have them for the remaining period.

- members who fraud faction applications (applying from secondary accounts with the aim of forcing the closure of applications for friends, having friends apply with the same purpose, or other such situations - the sanction is given regardless of the faction you belong to, even if it does not correspond with the one where you committed the fraud, and applies to all accounts where you are a faction member).

!!! danger "Important"
    If you have received a ban of 3 days or more, you will only be able to remain in the faction if you are unbanned through an unban request, not if you purchase an unban with gold.

## 9. Blacklist

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1.1</span> Players of <span style="color:var(--pink);">at least level 7</span> can be added to the blacklist, whether they are part of a faction or civilians.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1.2</span> Adding a player to the blacklist will be done by members of rank 4+ and only based on clear evidence that will be posted on the forum in the evidence topic for the blacklist (<span style="color:red;">sanctions: Faction Warn for the first offense</span>, <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> if it continues).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1.3</span> Removing a player from the blacklist will be done by members of rank 4+ in case a player was added mistakenly, removing players without reason being sanctioned (<span style="color:red;">sanctions: Faction Warn for the first offense</span>, <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> if it continues).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1.4</span> Players on the blacklist can be constantly killed [exception for departments] until they pay the blacklist fee, except in Safe Zones and during important activities such as events, markets, legal jobs, auctions, etc.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1.5</span> For DM/DB actions, a player can only be blacklisted if they have not already been sanctioned through [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/emergency</span>] or reported within the faction and punished for it, to avoid double penalization of players. (<span style="color:red;">sanctions: Faction Warn for the first offense</span>, <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> if it continues).

### Blacklist Warnings

- <span style="color:orange;">1 warning:</span> excessive severe insults towards a member or the faction, disruption of a member's duty, inappropriate DM/DB, kamikaze, /q on tie.
- <span style="color:red;">2 warnings:</span> vulgar language, excessive DM/DB, excessive disruption of a member during their duty or activities, tampering with entrance tests alongside a 3-month ban.

!!! example "Info note"
    Blacklisting will not be granted to departments for things that can be sanctioned with a wanted status. </br>
    One warning will be issued for each offense.

### Paying the Blacklist

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2.1</span> Faction players on the blacklist have 72 hours, if they do not have an inactivity request, to pay the blacklist fee. Otherwise, they will be initially sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span>, and if the blacklist fee is not paid within the next 24 hours, the member will be <span style="color:red;">dismissed.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2.2</span> The blacklist fee is paid on the website or directly in-game through specific commands, without giving the money to a member of that faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2.3</span> Once the payment has been made, the player will be automatically removed from the blacklist.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2.4</span> It is forbidden for faction members to ask or accept money for the blacklist instead of informing the player to use the appropriate commands (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).

## 10. Others

### Tester Status

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.1.1</span> This status is assigned by the leader to members of at least rank 4 when they deem it appropriate.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.1.2</span> Members with this status are obligated to respect [Leader Rules -> Testing Candidates](../leaders/leader-rules.md/#testing-candidates), and will be sanctioned accordingly for any violations.

### Multiple Accounts and Shared IP

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.2.1</span> Members with multiple accounts (those who own more than one account) are not allowed to have more than one account in the same faction.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.2.2</span> Three different days (IN THE LAST 7 DAYS) of logs (SA:MP Login) are sufficient to determine that 2 members from the same faction frequently share their account. In this situation, we will consider them players with multiple accounts in the same faction and both accounts will be dismissed.

!!! danger "Important"
    For players who play from the same location and share a common IP, in order for both to be part of the same faction, it is necessary to [open a ticket on the RPG website](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/ticket) to perform some checks and allow this to happen.

### Jobs

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3.1</span> You can hold any type of legal or illegal job.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3.2</span> The leader has the right to force members to use a certain job for a specific period of time in order to carry out faction work (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

### Skins

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.4.1</span> You are allowed to wear skins of lower rank than your own rank (e.g., if you are rank 5, you can wear skins from ranks 1-4).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.4.2</span> Skins purchased from Platinum, Diamond, or Onyx type businesses in Clothes can be worn unless the Internal regulations specify otherwise.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.4.3</span> Wearing a skin of a higher rank is not permitted (<span style="color:red;">penalty: Verbal Warning</span> for first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> if it continues).

!!! example "Info note"
    With Leader's permission, other skins can be worn apart from the rules mentioned above.

### Meetings and Activities

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.5.1</span> Mandatory activities can be organized by the leader with a well-founded reason and the approval of a Senior Admin. Considering they will be quite rare, all members must attend and are not entitled to leave, except for players who have submitted an inactivity request for that week. A mandatory activity is valid as long as it is announced at least one week in advance (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.5.2</span> Helpers are required to participate in mandatory activities since they already benefit from halved reports.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.5.3</span> For rank 6 members, leaders will decide whether to sanction their absence from mandatory activities when they do not have an inactive or leave request submitted.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.5.4</span> For level 1-3 admins, if the mandatory activity takes place during wars, they will be automatically excused, provided they fulfill their admin duties regarding catching coders.

### Fines

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.6</span> If you have an unpaid fine, you have 48 hours to make the payment directly in-game using the command [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/fines</span>]. Otherwise, you will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span>. Fines are to be paid only from your own funds by the member in question.

### Exceptions

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.7</span> We reserve the right to make exceptions to these rules. In certain cases, the sanctions may be different.<br/>
These exceptions can only be made with the permission of an Admin 6.
