!!! example "Info note"
    If you don't tow for an hour, the number of untowed cars will be added to the next hour's count.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.3</span> When you want to start your activity, you must announce on the faction chat [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/f</span>] that you are taking the Tow Truck, to avoid confusion regarding missing cars (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Fine</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.4</span> After finishing your activity with the respective Tow Truck, you must respawn the Tow Truck and announce on the faction chat [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/f</span>] that it has been respawned (example: "I respawned tow truck / tt rr" ...etc) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Fine</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.5</span> Tow Trucks are strictly used for towing, not for personal use (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the next).

!!! example "Info note"
    For personal needs, you can use Utility (minimum rank 3) or personal vehicles.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.6</span> The areas from which you can tow are quite varied, from simple areas where you need to respect the minimum required rules (e.g., towing a car in a neutral zone, on the road), to areas with special regulations (e.g., Safe Zones, certain road sections or Spawns). For these, multiple pictures will be explicitly displayed, to know if towing those vehicles is correct or not. These areas are presented in the special topic [Legal / Illegal Towing](https://forum.b-zone.ro/topic/386771--).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.7</span> Faction and secondary job vehicles, planes, and helicopters require [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/dl</span>] under 1000HP to be towed and entered into the checkpoint. These vehicles have special regulations and can be towed from any location, excluding HQs or specially designated areas.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.11</span> If you tow a personal vehicle and notice that it is parked in the same location considered unauthorized, it means it has [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/park</span>] there and must be towed to a nearby location that does not obstruct traffic. If you tow a car with [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/park</span>] 3 times, 15 minutes each time, it is considered report fraud (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.12</span> You are not allowed to tow a vehicle when a player is inside, whether they are AFK or not (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.13</span> If someone calls after you to leave their car, you are obliged to do so (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.14</span> To see the number of tows made, access the RPG website in the section [My Account -> Faction Reports](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/factionReports) or you can use the in-game command [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/raport</span>].

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.15</span> The amount of money you receive does not vary depending on the vehicle, but rather on the rank held.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.16</span> You are obligated when towing a vehicle to have evidence with [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/dl</span>] turned on that you have correctly towed it, evidence that may be requested by a rank 6 (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.17</span> Subleaders or the Leader can request proof at any time for a towed vehicle. If you do not have proof, you will be <span style="color:red;">sanctioned with a Faction Warn</span>.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">5.18</span> You cannot be sanctioned by PD members as long as your siren is on and you are performing a tow. Do not abuse this to drive against traffic. In case of any complaint, you must have evidence from your perspective.

!!! danger "Important"
    If you are reported for illegal towing and you don't have evidence, you will be sanctioned for illegal towing (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).
